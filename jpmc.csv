Nothing to do with blockchains and DLT.  Do you even work in data management?  You sound like an idiot.

aqouta,"Mortgages make sense on the blockchain, obviously a financial institute would act as a custodian for your keys. The tokens would simply link together a chain of supporting documents so that actual ownership would be proved by documents that are hashed and reference the erc-721 tokens. The benefit of this is that it greatly simplifies the onboarding process for financial institutions when they trade existing mortgages, right now thousands of dollars of due diligence has to be performed where an originator will track down documents to determine things like whether there are existing liens and property details. These documents are often all over the place and would benefit from having a central repository linked to mortgages. Liens themselves could also be their own class of erc-721 tokens to even further simplify the process.

If you're serious, disciplined and willing, sit down, go on free code camp or something and just learn stuff and add to your resume. Compile a portfolio on your git, make a tribute site, look for contract work to build a client base. 

&amp;#x200B;

My story was 

\-Did a psych degree, 

\-Eventually did an MS in Comp Sci sure BUT, there was 3 years in-between where I did light app dev (android/iOS) and front-end work, I just did free exercises online and experimented with xcode and android studio. After undergrad I was the type that learned by doing rather than sitting down and listening/watching or even reading. In grad school I liked that it was project-based rather than just exams or tests, because I found myself reusing info I learned by doing personal projects or professional work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Degrees make it easier to get into some places, some require a degree just cuz HR or whoever said so but, lot of my friends have non-CS degrees and work in the field doing just fine (NYC is our area, might vary) and a minority never went to college but again, are kicking ass and doing just fine at JPMC, BNYM, Some are at startups (Doing very well tbh), and the like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hmu with questions, happy to answer. Best of luck with whatever you decide! I would recommend a non-stem MS program IMO, worth it if you're serious/older/mature, as you can find some cheap ones. I did NJIT, but I recommend you do Georgia Tech, entire degree will run you 6-7K and I found out after spending about 23K and counting but said EFF it and just finished at NJIT but if I wasn't almost done, I'd have done Georgia Tech.

I have seen many new grads nurses and interviewed them personally and that, most just do for the money without having the heart into it.

Like the saying goes ‚Äògaji buta‚Äô. The intellectual level and critical thinking of nurses must be the same as the doctors. Like they can anticipate what the doctors would instruct or do. If you ask me to compare between RIPAS and JPMC (altho i aint going to reveal where i work) JPMC simply hires best of the best nurses (in terms of good education, experiences etc) both local and expats. Hence a premium hospital. Ripas ... well we all know but at least theres govt benefits.

TheHolyLampshade,"&gt; easier to get into...Houston  
This is true. It's actually true of most regional markets/schools. There's a higher likelihood of recruiters on campuses for jobs in Houston or Dallas, and Houston has a large finance sector supporting mostly the energy industry.

&gt; but the competition is insane

This is not meant to discourage you, but if you think UT is too competitive you're not going to like your chances for the super sexy finance careers in NYC or Chicago. Baring recruitment right out the gate into one of those cities you're probably going to find it a little challenging to transfer in from a regional market. That's not to say it's impossible, but it will likely be easier as an internal transfer at some firm (for example, get a gig with JPMC in Houston, then find a way to transfer to one of their NYC offices).

&gt; getting a job...out of TAMU [or] UTD

I don't know what the recruitment situation looks like at these schools now. I imagine the big firms will probably have recruitment agents at most of the big career events, but just given your bit about competition it's important to understand that these jobs are **extremely** (I cannot put enough emphasis on this) competitive. Every kid wants to be the big swinging dick making a million dollars. That isn't meant to suggest you don't have a chance, but you have to understand that you are up against some real hungry motherfuckers. You're going to have to work extremely hard to make your way in, especially from a non-target out-of-state school.

That said, Texas does have plenty of trading firms, and there's a fair bit of ""high finance"" wrapped around the energy and tech industries, and so if you're willing to stay in State, and you kill it in school, I'd think there's a pretty good chance of doing well for yourself. NYC/Chicago transfers are not out of the picture, but you'll probably have to put some time in to make it happen.",2019-06-19 18:15:19,erjnndp,2,FinancialCareers
harimaurimba,"I've had my fair share of being at my lowest point in the last 2 years. Luckily, I pulled myself through and got as much help as I needed/wanted. I'm much better now but I still have a lot to deal with yet. Kinda a shame for me to actually be able to answer these questions but its better to put it out there in case someone else needs it.

&gt;What are your steps to overcome this matter?

Having someone to talk to and be honest with helps a lot. But professional help is always recommended because more of than not, our family and friends just don't know how to help us. I jumped between RIPAS psychology, JPMC and finally Clarity for therapy and counselling. RIPAS is entirely free, you can call them to book an appointment/session and they will even accept walk-ins. However, the private therapists and clinical psychologists are much better in my opinion. I will vouch for Clarity because they've done me a lot of good and are arguably much better than the doctors tied to the government.

&gt;how helpful is the talian 145? How do you convince someone in need to call this line?

This is tough to answer. I think it really depends on each person and the operator at the time but my experience with them at *that* time wasn't very positive. I don't think they were very impactful by the end but they did try and I guess it worked..? They eventually get your necessary information and get you help as soon as possible. I think its a great initiative nonetheless but I don't think its impactful enough yet. I honestly have no idea what to think about this. The service is still kinda vague in Brunei. I haven't had to deal with any follow-up with them since.

&gt;How helpful are the private and the public psychologists in Brunei?

See above. Adding to it, I think the quality of service is generally good. I have some qualms with the government doctors though which was why I left them. I mentioned this to my private doctors at JPMC and Clarity and they also clarified that this always happens. It kinda feels like the government doctors are slight restricted in how they help us confront our problems, probably due to MIB etc.

&gt;what are your side information or message you want to add in order to help these people?

Speaking from my own experience, some families suck. And some really do. And its fine to accept that. Of course the saying that ""parents know best"" are usually true but you have to realize when a physically and mentally abusive relationship is toxic and destroying your health and self esteem. I spent my entire childhood/youth believing that all of that was necessary and that all I needed was to constantly adapt and satisfy other's needs before my own.

Weaponomics,"&gt; ‚ÄúUS Bancorp didn‚Äôt want the bailout....Wells Fargo (who got 25 billion) was a different story‚Äù


This claim - that US Bancorp was uniquely good and Wells uniquely bad vis-a-vis the bailouts - is entirely unsupported

All the big banks were forced to get bailouts. Citigroup, Wells, BofA, Chase, MorganStanley, PNC, Bancorp, Suntrust - they all repaid, and ahead-of-schedule. MOST of the banks never wanted the bailout. The largest ones all paid them off within a month of *being legally allowed to*. Of the big 4, JPMC &amp; Wells were the only one to not receive special assistance *beyond* the bailouts. The US government made a massive amount of money off of this. 

It was the medium-sized banks and the large automotive companies that never repaid.

Btw (not to scare you but) my friend was 19 when he went to emergency 4 times only to be told it wasn‚Äôt cancer. They finally checked him only when he almost died from bloody diarrhea to diagnose him with cancer So no such thing as impossible, just not so great doctors.

You also probably need to get checked out for hemorrhoids as a possibility for bleeding. CT Scan can help to detect tumors (if large enough). Colonoscopy is probably to most important for your case as it will tell you the source of your bleeding and why you have pain in your right abdomen. Appendicitis is another possibility but doesn‚Äôt explain the bleeding. Tumor markers don‚Äôt always work yet if the cancer hasn‚Äôt invaded the blood stream. Could be IBS or Colitis or Crohns.

Best get a second opinion if no progress at ripas. Avoid jpmc since their specialist are basically from ripas. Go to KK or KL if you can. Try to get a copy of all your scans and reports before you go.

Interviews: Multiple Mini Interview which includes about 10 stations or so. 
1. They may ask about Brunei Healthcare system (the primary, secondary, tertiary level), pros &amp; cons of Bruhims, naming Brunei hospitals &amp; healthcentres, any work attachments 
2. They ask questions about yourself: the typical why you want to be a doctor, what qualities should a good doctor possesses, your weakness/strengths, backup plan if you‚Äôre rejected for the program
3. Give a 5 min speech about a certain topic: I got healthy lifestyle
4. Questions about ethics
5. Give a presentation about yourself: you‚Äôll be asked to make a powerpoint slide before the interview: include your interests/hobbies, achievements, hopes &amp; aspirations etc the point is to sell yourself
6. Critical thinking questions: they give you a picture of a certain scenario (eg flooding) and they‚Äôll ask what kind of diseases might arise, what kind of help should be sent etc
7. Just be aware of any recent medical news 


For me, it doesnt really change my life that drastically provided that you are good with managing your time and getting things done. I can still manage my sleep &amp; balance my social life. Of course, the closer you are to the exams, the harder it‚Äôs gonna be to juggle between all these things but thats a given.

First girl wasn't that bad on my penis because she's kinda loose down there but I noticed slight pain when she went down on me. Couple of playful time later, is when I met this other girl. Foreskin rolled back and revealed my mushroom head when I took off the condom. Never seen it before and panicked. She saw my panicked face and told me my penis's fine. Went to shower and tried to roll it down but had to really try hard. After that, had sex with multiple girls and I guess my foreskin became more flexible and will keep rolling back during sex (if BJ, definitely will rollback so I have to roll it down before putting condom on). 18 year old and never had my foreskin rolled back until I came to the UK. I have hypersensitive penis head case, and even a slight touch will be painful. Told my parents I want to get circumcision during year 2 and 3 of my degree but held it back because I was scared. Before flying over here for my Masters, I finally put my foot down and told parents I wanted to do the procedure. They immediately called JPMC and I was circumcised 2 days after. If you want to feel good when you lose your virginity, get it sorted out or it'll hurt. Took me 3 months to recover and have sex again. Now I'm in the UK and my penis is great! 

I've read that you should put steroid cream and start to slowly roll your foreskjn back. Because you will lose a lot of nerve after circumcision and sex will not feel good anymore.

ryzvonusef,"&gt; Although figures for suicide and suicide attempts are notoriously sketchy in the country, doctors agree that they are seeing an increase in the number of such cases.
&gt; 
&gt; What they indicate, however, is that aside from increasing stressors, there is a mental health emergency that remains unaddressed.
&gt; 
&gt; Draped in a red plaid scarf worn loosely around her head, 21-year-old Aasia* has just been shifted to the ward after five days in intensive care. Her skin looks pale and her legs are flexed.
&gt; 
&gt; Even at 21, Aasia seems to have carried the weight of the world on her tender shoulders. And perhaps, this burden was all too much for her to bear: Aasia is in hospital after ingesting rat poison in an attempt to end her life.
&gt; 
&gt; Standing beside her is an elderly man, her father, while her mother is sitting on a vacant bed next to her. ‚ÄúAasia doesn‚Äôt have any mental health issues,‚Äù her father avows.
&gt; 
&gt; The family has been lodged at the National Poison Control Centre (NPCC) at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical and Dental Centre (JPMC) in Karachi ever since Aasia was brought in.
&gt; 
&gt; The father simply doesn‚Äôt understand how matters came to such a head. Being the only daughter remaining in the house after the marriage of her six elder sisters, he claims she is loved unconditionally.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúShe tried to end her life because her mother had taken her to task for cooking the food too spicy,‚Äù he narrates. ‚ÄúShe was making mistakes for the past few days while preparing meals for the family and was being criticised over that.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Little did the parents know the toll such taunts were taking on Aasia. Fed up with the bickering, Aasia consumed poison. It took the family three hours to take Aasia to the NPCC, but luckily, they reached in time.
&gt; 
&gt; On the extreme right to Aasia lies another young woman named Khizra* who attempted suicide by consuming insecticide. The 20-year-old was admitted to the hospital a few hours ago and is now stable after receiving the treatment.
&gt; 
&gt; A small quarrel with her younger brother over ironing of clothes had made her feel worthless and convinced her to take her own life.
&gt; 
&gt; Khizra ran and consumed insecticide soon after the quarrel was over, giving no time to the family to comprehend the situation. Her mother laments that children don‚Äôt think about their parents when they resort to such extreme decisions.
&gt; 
&gt; Aasia and Khizra are only two of the patients admitted at Ward 5 of JPMC.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many other patients of both genders who have either intentionally ingested poison or are victims of venomous insect bites or stings.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr Muhammad Junaid Mahboob, resident doctor at the NPCC, tells Eos that approximately 15-20 patients are admitted daily at the NPCC, many of whom consume poison deliberately in order to kill themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; The number of patients brought in is surprisingly higher on weekends.
&gt; 
&gt; While 98 percent of the patients of intentional poisoning survive, Dr Mahboob states that the survival chances depend on the type of poison, the amount taken, and the time it takes to reach the hospital.
&gt; 
&gt; While poisoning is one of the three leading modes of suicide in Pakistan besides hanging and firearms, Dr Mahboob specifies insecticide and rat poison as the most-opted poisonous substances by people who attempt suicide. The other less-reported poisonous substances are phenyl and acids.
&gt; 
&gt; Explaining the reasons of poisoning, he says, the most common problems reported by patients are loneliness, family quarrels, domestic violence, and interpersonal relationship issues.
&gt; 
&gt; The NPCC, established in 1989 with the help of the World Health Organisation (WHO), treats patients of intentional and accidental poisoning.
&gt; 
&gt; As routine practice, doctors at the centre recommend all suicide survivors to see a psychiatrist at Ward 20, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science, when they are being discharged.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite doctors‚Äô recommendation and the psychiatry ward being only a few metres away from the NPCC, Dr Mahboob believes that not many patients see a psychiatrist because they never accept they need professional help.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äú[Underlying] causes when left untreated increases the vulnerability to suicide risk after attempted suicide,‚Äù he says.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúWithin the first six to 12 months following a suicide attempt, people are at increased risk of another attempt,‚Äù corroborates Dr Murad Moosa Khan, president of the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) and professor at the Department of Psychiatry, Aga Khan University.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúSince these people have already experienced death closely, they are not afraid of dying anymore,‚Äù he elaborates. ‚ÄúThis persuades them to attempt suicide more aggressively.‚Äù",2019-05-13 02:45:53,en8oiqu,2,pakistan
harimaurimba,"I PM'd OP this but I feel like it helps to inform others too.

&gt;1. Treatment is only 1 or 2 pills once or twice DAILY. Emphasis on daily because you cannot miss it or you risk your viral load to mutate and adapt to your treatment. You will have to do this for the rest of your life unless they find a cure for HIV during our lifetime.

&gt;2. It is by law strictly confidential. Not even regular doctors or nurses will have access to your Bruhims medical records. Treatment will be handled by specialized doctors and nurses of RIPAS' Infectious Disease unit in the PHY department. Even if you go to JPMC or other private clinic for tests, your positive case will still be reported to MoH because its their national duty to control the disease.

&gt;3. Patients get to live normal lives. HIV doesn't necessarily take a toll on you unless you leave it undiagnosed and untreated for several years (the initial mild symptoms show early on but then the virus becomes dormant for a couple years before it resurfaces worse). So get checked as early as possible. You have regular appointments every 3-4 months to check your viral load and it happens less often once you are tested Undetectable. You are forced to get annual flu shots though from now on. Otherwise, your HIV status affects nothing else. Your job prospects remain untouched except for any medical fields. And employers have no access to your status unless the law asks for it.

&gt;4. Just go to RIPAS and get a regular ""checkup"". Tell them you have buasir or diarrhea or whatever at the triage. Then when you meet the doctor, tell them that you're just really concerned and want a HIV test. They'll maybe ask some personal questions but nonetheless they'll give you the tests.

69CumfuckScatfart420,"Also, you still haven't mentioned how much workplace experience you have or if you have any personal experience with interviewing candidates. Yes, theoretically that is an appeal to authority fallacy, but in practice it does matter because it informs how deeply you're able to understand study methodologies/results -- here's an example from just today.

Early this morning, I replied to a typically misinformed political post quoting Liz Warren saying that ""Chase [bank] was bailed out by taxpayers in 08."" I made a reply correcting that misinformation, stating how JPMC was never at risk of insolvency but the Treasury didn't want to risk Bear Stearns collapsing like Lehman so they forced JPMC to acquire Bear and sweetened the deal with loan assurances on the tens of billions in toxic assets that Bear had. So on paper, JPMC also became liable for the Bear actions that eventually drew fines, and also technically accepted TARP money, but it was all at the government's request and JPMC was never ""bailed out."" However, I instantly got several replies with people giving links to know-nothing CNN articles that included JPMC on the list of ""TARP recipients"" and ""companies fined for actions leading to the mortgage lending crash,"" despite none of those reductionist conclusions actually being applicable to JPMC.

And even after correcting these people with the accurate chain of events and explaining what ""bailout"" means, they refused to acknowledge these uncontroversial events and just stuck with their inaccurate CNN article dogma! The reason why they do that, is because they distrust that an anonymous internet stranger like me would actually have domain experience in this area, so they trust CNN over the primary sources I'm spoon-feeding them.

Similarly, I have a very hard time believing that your pop-sociology conclusions about racial discrimination existing in modern hiring practices against black/Latin/women overpowering the effect of diversity quotas, because you simply haven't walked a mile in these shoes of an interviewer. I have no doubt you can find myriad sources supporting your views, just like people can do for the gender pay gap or other purposefully-misrepresented hot-button issues, but I also have no doubt that if we delved into the methodologies/limitations of those studies my experiences would be validated.

For instance, in 2004 Trump asked the bank‚Äôs commercial real-estate group to lend him more than $500 million to build his 92-story skyscraper in Chicago; it did, but not before employees concluded he was majorly inflating his net worth, and were told he‚Äôd ‚Äúworked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.‚Äù Ten years later, when Trump was trying to buy the Buffalo Bills and needed to prove to the league he had the funds to pull off a transaction that could exceed $1 billion, the bank agreed to vouch that his worth was $8.7 billion, something his former fixer Michael Cohen told lawmakers was an (obvious, extreme) exaggeration back in February.

retroguy02,"I have worked in private hospitals in Karachi myself as a doctor and I think the fault lies in two places: 1) The government's total abdication of healthcare to shady private sector players who will cut every corner for profit (same goes for education), 2) Our public's total lack of trust in the legal system to address their complaints. As a result, everyone thinks that mob-driven media trials are their best chance at justice, even though the media creates hype only for ratings.

I can't count how many times I've seen attendants pull out a phone and record doctors (even female ones) if they go for a bathroom break or take a few extra minutes to attend to a non-critical patient because they were busy with other patients. All hospital administrations should put up large banners in ERs that anyone caught recording video for any reason would be kicked out and not treated - the patient's loss is on them and a FIR should be filed for harassment and obstruction of duty.

Yes, the Nashwa case gained so much media hype because her father worked for ARY but I can't blame a man who lost his daughter to be overcome by his emotions. There are thousands of Nashwas in every govt hospital in Karachi and such incidents happen routinely in private hospitals too but they don't get highlighted because their parents don't have such connections - if her father really wants justice and wants to prevent such incidents from happening again, sealing hospitals isn't the solution, it will only satisfy the public's thirst for revenge (I've seen calls for publicly hanging doctors on Facebook) and then be forgotten. The Sindh govt is taking the lead in shutting down the hospital responsible for this case but will it also acknowledge its role in the deaths of thousands of Nashwas in JPMC, Civil Hospital or the thousands in interior Sindh who were written off by our ex-CM as acts of nature?

The govt needs to take responsibility and institute protocols for proper training and screening of healthcare workers, take strict action against hospitals hiring untrained workers and it also needs to pass legislation for a higher minimum wage in health sector so that qualified, experienced doctors and health professionals are encouraged to stay rather than seeking better jobs abroad.",2019-04-28 15:10:47,elyu4wz,4,pakistan

jechan85,"Purchasing Power Parity (or PPP) adjusts the measurement to accommodate different cost of living in different countries.

For example, it is commonly heard about Brunei being the fifth 'richest' country in the world, after Qatar, Macau, Luxembourg and Singapore. That is by PPP per capita.

On average, Bruneians earn lower than other nationalities like Swiss, Singaporeans, Japanese, Australians, Norwegian, this is quite obvious. But thanks to the extensive welfare and subsidies, it artificially boost the PPP.

But does that mean Bruneians are better off?

Now do you seriously believe Brunei is better off than Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Japan, etc as Brunei has higher PPP per capita than them? 

People in these countries earn very high income. But on the other hand their cost of living are also very high.

Bruneians earn high income (well compared to world average it is high, not as high as above countries though), and low cost of living.

And here comes the main point. Those countries, their high cost of living also include world class infrastructure, world class telecommunication/internet, high connectivity with the rest of world, world class medical facilities, world class education, world class transportation, etc.

Brunei's low cost of living gets you mediocre medical facilities (go JPMC for world class), average education (go ISB/JIS for world class), mediocre telecom/internet, mediocre transportation, little connectivity to the world (Paypal no, limited direct flight routes, no direct delivery in many international ecommerce stores, etc).

Some might say, oh I'm fine with lower quality of life, mediocre infrastructure and facilities as long as my life is covered. Then comes the next question, if the future life progression is very limited for you and your family, while for outside the sky is the limit. Do you want such trade-off?

If you still want it then that is you. You want a life of dullness and mediocrity. Outside people are living the progressive and productive life, even with higher cost they will not get impressed by your lifestyle, [summed up in this post I already made](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/b8vun1/time_to_realize_bruneis_welfare_subsidies_and/). 

You can easily get the answer, if you ask even the Mirians if they want to emigrate to Singapore, they will say they want it, they know Singapore is a good place to live, but the only concerns is about the living cost. If you ask them whether they want to emigrate to Brunei, you will hear the big NO, they want to earn BND but they never want to live in Brunei the rest of their life.

ucantharmagoodwoman,"&gt;Do you have have proof to back up any of those claims? These imaginary multinational monopolies don't exists in the real world. 

Sure, [here's some very recent research into the fact and effects of industry consolidation.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/merger-consolidation-wages-effect)

&gt;There are tons of alternatives for products out there. Go to any supermarket and you'll see 10 different brands of water and baby bottles. There is actual data for how much market share each company has.

You'd think, but, sadly, [no.](https://openmarketsinstitute.org/explainer/consumer-choice-and-monopoly/) What is deceptively presented as an alternative to something on a grocery shelf is more often than not a product made one of only a few companies. 

&gt;&gt;They can also do things like bribe lawmakers to pass laws that let them steal water, pump poison into the air and soil, build oil lines that destroy habitats and make baby bottles with plastics that are known to cause cancer.

&gt;It usually a giant PR disaster whenever a company is caught doing any of those things and they take a huge hit in their market share and value.

&gt;&gt;It hasn't always been like this, and it doesn't need to be like this, now. The average person would have drastically improved living standards if corporations weren't allowed to pull this crap, and it wouldn't have to cost them more.

&gt;It hasn't always been like this but it does always have to be like this. It wasn't like this in the past because human quality of life was worse in the past relative to now. If you want to go back to the past were things were more sustainable, then you're gonna have to live like that time period and give up your quality of life.

Improvements in technology are what have improved quality of life, not corporatocracy. I mean, really? You think psychotic, rabid, unchecked profit-seeking is to be credited for that? No. 

&gt;&gt;The average person would have drastically improved living standards if corporations weren't allowed to pull this crap, and it wouldn't have to cost them more.

&gt;No they wouldn't that goes against all logic. If companies cut down on their waste and make less things then people with more money will just pay more for those things and raise the overall price, lowering quality of life for everyone below them on the social economic scale.

This is literally just denying my original claim. You haven't given me any response. 

&gt;Plus this is all dependent on zero competitors popping up. If companies actually did what you suggested and went with more sustainable but expensive practices, any competitor will be free to join and use their old practices and beat them out of the market. 

Do you know what the word ""monopoly"" means?

&gt;It all comes down to the individuals consumers changing their habits and willingly lowering their quality of life, companies are just there to do what the consumers want, they're not the ones forcing consumers to buy things. The individual needs to change their attitude and accept a shittier quality of life or else they'll just keep propping up companies that offer better quality of life in exchange for more pollution.

mrmalfoy,"&gt; But should the responsibility fall (solely) upon MS for that decision?

Not solely, but it certainly falls upon MS as well. There's a reason that brokers ask you things like 'are you a director, executive, 10% shareholder in a company' etc when you open an account, and it isn't out of concern about the account holder's well being. They are required to ensure they are being compliant, and regardless of how the option/swap/etc was set up they weren't abiding by Lyft's prospectus [again, assuming this alleged action occurred. I have no idea if it did or not].

&gt; If the investors went to another broker instead of a managed account, and decided to short shares, they would be able to do so right?

No, they wouldn't. They are still restricted by the lock up period specified under the prospectus and governed under SEC Rule 144. I really suggest you read the [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759509/000119312519059849/d633517ds1.htm), specifically pages 201-203, if you're interested in understanding it better. It literally states that pre-IPO holders cannot sell or hedge any shares or converts into shares for 180 days without prior written consent from JPMC.

&gt; The clients themselves should ultimately be responsible for that investment decision imo

I don't disagree that the clients/pre-IPO holders are also responsible. I'm just saying that MS appears to be jointly responsible as described by security laws &amp; Lyft's S-1. For full clarity though, I am not a lawyer.",2019-04-08 03:30:13,ekc1cih,2,thewallstreet

PragmaticSquirrel,"I‚Äôll post the justice system one separately and the lending one as separate comments.

Loans- no. The biggest offenders were Wells Fargo, B of A, and JPMC. But suntrust PNC and a dozen more household names were guilty too. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúshitty loan shark‚Äù places. It‚Äôs massive multi national banks.

Legacy- when ‚Äúthose with legacy‚Äù are massively disproportionally white- it is massively racially biased. You think racism has to have intent- if a person didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmean‚Äù to be racist, then it‚Äôs not racist.

I‚Äôm saying- racially biased= racism. It doesn‚Äôt have to be intentional. If it is massively disproportionately favorable to a skin color that already has massive advantages (median wealth/ income, admissions rates, employment rates, etc), then the *effect* is racist.

If they only gave school scholarships for skiing, and only wore families could afford to give their kids the necessary equipment and training for skiing- it would be racist. Likewise legacy admissions- when ‚Äúpeople who graduated from highly ranked schools a generation ago‚Äù are Massively disproportionately white, then the effect is racially biased. And persisting with that effect, knowing that it is massively racially biased- is racist.

Easy test. Could a racist use the system to push a racist agenda, but hide behind the fact that ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre not Explicitly favoring whites‚Äù? If the answer is yes- the intention, which is 100% unknowable, is irrelevant. The outcome is racially biased. And so the system of legacy admissions is racist.

If the Only source of scholarship was ‚Äúborn in the ghetto‚Äù, or the biggest impact to admissions was ‚Äúborn in the ghetto‚Äù, regardless of race- many many whites would cry ‚Äúracism!‚Äù And I could say ‚Äúbut a white born in the ghetto gets that advantage too! So what that only 0.0001% of whites are born in the ghettos we‚Äôve chosen for this system! It‚Äôs not about race!‚Äù",2019-03-31 01:59:45,ejqyylb,8,AskALiberal

Bruneianrefugee,"That actually is a good idea. And throw in the year supply of diapers every Bruneian mum gets. What‚Äôs a few hundred dollars worth of diapers compared to the tens of thousands you‚Äôd be charging for the actual birth. On that note I‚Äôd turn that first crate of diapers into something iconically cultural of Brunei. Much like the [new mother starter kit](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415) in Finland where we got the idea to provide mothers in Brunei with diapers. 

Literally guys, Finland‚Äôs starter kit was referred to specifically in the proposal paper.

Anyway 10 is about the number I expected with the establishment of Gleneagles Kota Kinabalu. We actually might have achieved a number higher than 10 before Gleneagles KK was around but of course I now don‚Äôt have those files to refer to. 

Still that should underline to you the stiff competition we now have in our immediate neighbours whereas at one point a rich Indonesian businessman from Pontianak had used Gleneagles JPMC because it was the most advanced cardiac suite in Borneo and he wanted a facility his entire family could drive to as opposed to having flight as the only option if he went to Singapore or Jakarta. 

That case stood out to me cos it was rather unusual. But it highlighted how big a lead Brunei actually had in our immediate backyard. Now that lead is over, it‚Äôs destroyed. 

Gleneagles KK is here and fully operational in a much more tourist friendly city, offering cheaper prices for the same value and level of technical excellence. 

What if I told you rich HIV patients are a potential goldmine for the healthcare industry?  That‚Äôs why modern medicine is not in a rush to find a cure. People living with HIV tend to be gay men who tend to be unmarried or at least with few or no dependents. Lots of disposable income. They are living with a condition we can treat not not yet cure. HIV is now like diabetes, incurable but you can live as long as a healthy person with it with the right meds and lifestyle. 

Plus you have an ethical obligation to push vaccines that are meant for people with potential immunity compromises, which is exactly what HIV is. You can sell them all the vaccines. And the flu one is annual! You can insist on the gold standard of every 3 months for a full STI check up, viral load, liver function tests etc and this is all maintenance. 

If they get sick that‚Äôs extra income! 

HIV patients tend to be extremely healthy though cos of their regular contact with medical people and getting HIV in the first place tends to be a wake up call. So why not offer a healthy lifestyle package of nutritionist, psychologist and sport scientist for only $1200 every month? 

Goldmine! 

Of course imagine how prejudiced MoRA would be at the mere suggestion that we pander to not only gay medical tourists but HIV-positive gay medical tourists? I assure you Malaysia has no such prejudices at least when it comes to the treatment of HIV patients with money. 

I mean you‚Äôd just give your sex workers and sexually active gay male population access to prep and you just stopped the possibly of HIV spreading from these potential customers into your community even if there is a sudden condom shortage. Let the prep flow! 

Let me enlighten with these two facts. 

Fact 1: In 2016 GJPMC‚Äôs ten year lease was up and they were opting to end operations and consolidate the stagnate Brunei operations with the rapidly growing Gleneagles KK one.  Us at the office actually thought everything was confirmed, no more Gleneagles and our projected plans for the meet year not include them. 

It was a pleasant surprise that our negotiators managed to turn convince Gleneagles to sign up for another 10 years. Our office likes working with GJPMC, we maintain a very close working relationship. But from what I can see they are planing to just maintain a presence in a stagnate market. Not a growing one that‚Äôs getting growth from medical tourism. 

Fact 2: It‚Äôs hard to work out what the hell JPMC is... (a private business entity owned by the Brunei Investment Agency I suppose) but it and others like it including GJPMC have tried to get approval for various clinical procedures to be approved for commercialization in Brunei. Let‚Äôs just say they were mostly unsuccessful. 

Notice how GJPMC only maintains a cardiac service in Brunei. That‚Äôs the sign of an international health brand unwilling to put up with bullshit. Look at the full suite of services offered by Gleneagles kk. Oh my is that a plastic surgeon on their surgical team? And doesn‚Äôt their general practitioner list HIV care as one if his areas of interest? 

Face it Brunei, in medical tourism you done fucked it up. 

Mostly cos you fucked up the first rule in the health field, we cannot discriminate.

 At the very least, health professionals don‚Äôt discriminate or judge cos they are noble, nice people but self-interested professionals who don‚Äôt want to piss off potential customers. 

Brunei can stand to learn a few lessons from this failed foray into the medical tourism field. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not being talked about so they can‚Äôt...

**Brunei celebrate the 35th National Day on 23rd February 2019**

**Construction Boom**

After the independence in 1984, Brunei experience a ""construction boom"" mainly with HM government infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, drainage, housing schemes, schools, colleges, universities, hospital, clinics, health centres and government ministries started building their respective headquarters and other related buildings across the districts including water, sewerage, electrical, telephone services up to late 2000.

In tandem, JPMC, Empire Hotel &amp; Country Club, DST Tower, PMO Building Complex, Berakas Power Plant, and others structures were developed by Amedeo Development Corporation, which went bankrupt in 1998.

The temporary residents of Brunei increase during these period, comprising of general, semi and full skill labour as well as professionals from various countries.

The 2018/2019 budget allocation for 182 projects under the 11th National Development Plan (NDP) is B$900 million and 63.8% will go towards the transport and communications sector.¬†

Recent infrastructure projects that were financed by HM government,

1. the B$73 million Jalan Residency new four-lane road expansion connects the capital to Mukim Kota Batu, Mentiri and Lumapas via the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Bridge help to ease congestion for the 18,000 motorists who commute through the area daily. Parking spaces for Kampong Ayer residents are also provided throughout the entire stretch of Jalan Residency, accommodating up to 517 cars.
2. the B$139 million Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Bridge.
3. the 12-hectare riverfront park¬†
Taman Mahkota Jubli Emas, an urban redevelopment that is part of ambitious plans to revitalise the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan.
4. the B$1.6 billion, 30-kilometre Temburong mega bridge linking Jalan Kota Batu in Brunei-Muara district and Labu Estate in Temburong district. 
5. the B$85.5 million Ulu Tutong Golden Jubilee Dam aimed at increasing water supply to Brunei-Muara and Tutong districts to¬†600 million litres per day.
6. the B$168 million, 18.6-kilometre Telisai-Lumut Highway ease travel between the capital and the Belait District and reduce traffic congestion along the existing Lumut-Telisai road especially during peak hours.
7. the B$130 million modernisation of the Brunei International Airport is designed to increase capacity from 1.5m to 3m passengers annually providing an attraction and facilities for the public and tourists who are visiting or stopping by the airport.¬†
8. the B$69 million Woman and Children's block for the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha (RIPAS) Hospital.
9. the B$100 million Brunei Cancer Centre is located next to the Jerudong Park Medical Centre, also house the Brunei Neuroscience, Stroke and Rehabilitation Centre.

On the other hand, private commercial property development remain ""unattractive"" comprising of low rise shop - house complexes instead of modern all-in-1 mix commercial - retail - office - residential - hotel - indoor family entertainment centres type of property development.

**Financial Credit Boom**

While, estimated 60k government employees are mainly target segments for financial institutions and soon the  ""financial credit boom"".

A government employee may take personal loan up to 42 times monthly salary with financial institutions in Brunei.

The competition between the financial institutions to increase the personal loan market share peak with rampant persoanl loan takeover and counter offer by competing financial institutions.

While, the credit card market is ""uncheck"" as an individual may own credit cards from various financial institutions without the need for salary assignment and fixed deposit as collateral to match the credit card limit.

Imagine, one with a moderate monthly salary of $3,000 may have $6,000 credit limit with bank A, $9,000 credit limit with bank B and $3,000 credit limit with bank C. Mind boggling.

The purchase power that support our local retail / commercial markets for so long was not sustainable and soon saturated with ""bad loans"".

The financial market ""bubble burst"" and credit crunch hit as a result of cases of delinquant personal loans, mortgages, credit cards with 24% p.a. interest, repossed automobiles and properties to bankruptcies cases. 

**AMBD and Credit Bureau**

The AMBD steps in with the Credit Bureau that commenced its services in September 2012 to provide credit worthiness record of individual in Brunei.

First, the personal loan amount limit is reduced up to 12 times monthly salary for government employees and the Total Debt Service Ration (TDSR) also adjusted accordingly.

Secondly, in late 2000, the credit card eligibility is upgraded to include salary assignment and fixed-deposit as collateral to match the credit limit.

Anyone, that exceed the TDSR is offered a loan consolidation programme to convert credit card debt to personal loan up to 36 months repayment period at a much lower interest rate instead of the 24% p.a. interest rate for credit card.

Eventually, financial institutions, utility and telecommunication companies are required to submit customers credit / loan report to AMBD.

**Oil Price All-Time-High**

Inevitably, the effect of global oil supply-demand imbalance, combined with the 2008 commodity crash, was the perfect cocktail for the volatility in oil prices for the last 10 years and oil had been in the bear market for the last 5 years.

**Economic Diversification**

HM government support growth of Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise (MSME) in the food security and tourism industry, 

1. Food production industry by providing guidance on the food safety and technical aspect of the food production, packaging, labelling, nutrition facts, barcodes, expiry dates, HACCP certification and participation of selected MSME in expositions locally and abroad.
2. Fish farming industry at Sungai Brunei.
3. Rice farming industry at Wasan by far is a key economic diversification effort to reduce rice import and to boost the local rice output. 
4. Conventional and alternative vegetable farming at the Brunei Agricultural Research Centre (BARC) at Kilanas.
5. Darussalam Enterprise (DARe) provide local enterprenuers guidance on the various aspect of planning and managing business including pitching business plan and idea to potential investors.
6. Tourism industry by far include modernisation of the Brunei International Airport, while RB, the national carrier purchase new Airbus and Boeing airplanes to cater flights to existing and new destinations and as well as training and hiring local aircrews.

**Brunei Stock Exchange / Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) / Government Link Company (GLC)**

1. US$3.4 billion oil refinery and aromatic plant complex on Pulau Muara Besar by Hengyi Industries Sdn Bhd.
2. Brunei Methanol Company, a methanol manufacturing and exporting plant in Sungai Liang.
3. B$50 million margarine manufacturing plant in Serasa by Western Foods &amp; Packaging Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of edible oil and fats company Marsa Yag ‚Äì majority owned by the Turkish conglomerate Yildiz Holding and the Brunei government at 20% stake.
4. The CAE Brunei Multi-Purpose Training Centre is a joint venture between CAE, based in Canada, and the Government of Brunei Darussalam through the Ministry of Finance.
5. A total of $5 million has been allocated for the establishment of the Brunei stock exchange, which will be launched ‚Äúwithin the next few years‚Äù and the government has been working with Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) to lay the groundwork,¬†such as setting financial regulations, systems and infrastructure. The establishment of the stock exchange open doors for FDI (foreign direct investment) to come in and will help investors participate in equity investments and alternative stocks such as exchange traded funds, foreign equity stocks, bonds, investment funds, securitised products and real estate investment trusts.

**Write-up Summary**

Brunei experience these phases of development, after the independence in 1984,

1. Construction boom until late 2000 and the economic spill-over from¬†influx of temporary residents of Brunei.
2. Private commercial development remain ""unattractive"".
3. Financial credit boom until mid 2000.
4. Consumer purchasing power gradually increasing since the formation of Credit Bureau in 2012.
5. Average annual crude oil price all-time-high peak in 2011, 2012 until 2013.
6. On-going economic diversification towards Wawasan Brunei 2035.

While, there is no individual income tax nor value added tax  (VAT/GST) imposed on Brunei citizens and residents.

While, there are pressing issues face by HM government, including unemployment, and the drive to diversify the economy.

hei_mailma,"&gt;Can you expand on this?

If I'm not mistaken (and this is not my area of expertise), the ""branch"" on the blockchain is the one taken by 51% or more of nodes. This gives 51% of the nodes power about which branches to accept or not. If they consistently choose branches that are slower in a way that benefits a certain party (e.g. by letting it choose in retrospect whether to buy a certain stock in the past), then that party can make money (kind of like how HFT works).

&gt;But there is enough for JPMC to do it using blockchain?

I see it as more of a publicity stunt. ",2019-02-25 18:51:14,eh8jxsj,1,TheMotte
aqouta,"&gt;No, what I'm describing is a scenario where an attacker controls enough nodes to be able to introduce subtle timing differences that can be exploited for profit.

Can you expand on this? I can't think of a subtle timing difference that would be profitable and wouldn't set off the alarms on the other nodes being asked to follow chains that they have found to be illegitimate.

&gt;Idk, there may just not be enough demand for this kind of thing.

hei_mailma,"&gt; To be clear, the scenario you're describing is 51% of the major banks and fortune 500 companies that run these permissioned pnodes would conspire to rip jpmc or some other major company off so expertly that they don't even know they lost a large sum of money using a currently unknown form of sybil attack that leaves no trace. 

No, what I'm describing is a scenario where an attacker controls enough nodes to be able to introduce subtle timing differences that can be exploited for profit. 

&gt;But it runs into the same problem I've been outlining, you need to trust someone else's server completely.

Not if you get people to sign transactions cryptographically. I mean you still need to trust the server to some extent, but you also have signatures to verify.

&gt;If these things were trivial to do without blockchain a major bank would have already done it.

Idk, there may just not be enough demand for this kind of thing.",2019-02-25 07:38:55,eh7jfrs,1,TheMotte
aqouta,"&gt;If it's done by an amateur then sure, it's obvious and easily provable. If it's done by someone more sneaky then it's no longer as obvious.

Any form of sybil attack should be obvious to any honest node and raise a red flag.


&gt;The purpose of that would be that there would be fast and cryptographically verifiable transactions between parties. This is what this blockchain based solution claims to provide, and I just don't see why one would use something as complicated as blockchain if one wanted to provide that. 

You're just describing using a central ledger server and requiring cryptographic keys to access accounts, which is how things are often done. But it runs into the same problem I've been outlining, you need to trust someone else's server completely.

&gt;I'm not, I'm saying that *if* this scheme has any advantages then those advantages necessarily have to be from smart contracts because the other part is easier to do clasically without blockchain. 

If these things were trivial to do without blockchain a major bank would have already done it.",2019-02-25 00:45:53,eh6kumh,1,TheMotte
aqouta,"&gt; But then you're paying people to maintain your system, and you additionally need to trust that 51% of them don't get together and break the system in ways that benefit them.

This is the thing about Sybil attacks that I believe is least understood, the illegal act is maintained in the blockchain and is clearly provable. As was true with the ETH/ETC breakup. A Sybil attack could be countered by real world action and the proof would be on the blockchain itself.

&gt;Just like you can never fully trust a database controlled by multiple other entities. Your problem doesn't go away just because you throw some complexity and blockchain at it.

There will always be some problems but blockchain reduces the overhead.

&gt; Also the claim that blockchain is inherently fast is just not true.

I didn't make that claim, you did and I didn't challenge it. Blockchain is considered faster mainly compared to current processes that can take days. If your central server solution existed then it surely would be faster, but it doesn't. And it doesn't for the reasons of trust and risk. Instead currently each bank maintains their own ledger.

&gt;I feel like this whole thing would be easier if JPMC just did all the transactions, and gave out cryptographically signed (by all parties) receipts.

What would be the purpose of that?

&gt;You'd get all the benefits of this blockchain based approach other than ""smart"" contracts.

Don't dismiss smart contracts out of hand, they have many interesting use cases, certainly for payments but also for other types of transactions that banks oversee such as mortgages and other types of loans.",2019-02-24 19:47:26,eh62hkb,1,TheMotte
hei_mailma,"&gt; that is an entirely different thing to trust than the trust in the transaction itself.

No it's not completely unrelated. Since you're already trusting JPMC to honor the peg, why not trust them to also carry out transactions? In traditional cryptocurrencies you don't want to have to trust a central bank. But since in this case there *is*  a central bank, I just don't see what the benefit of having multiple nodes that don't need to trust each other is. Since JPMC is issuing coins, I also don't see what the point is in mining is for other people, unless they get paid to maintain the blockchain (like in etherium if I'm not mistaken).  But then you're paying people to maintain your system, and you additionally need to trust that 51% of them don't get together and break the system in ways that benefit them. 

&gt; Two of the 3 can but you can never fully trust a database controlled by another entity

aqouta,"&gt;This is a currency made by a single bank, backed by the US dollar. Decentralizing it in a way where you don't have to trust individual nodes sounds like a terrible idea.

Why do you feel that way? You have to trust JPMC to honor the peg but that's always the case. that is an entirely different thing to trust than the trust in the transaction itself. JPMC already does this kind of payment processing.

&gt;This can be done with any database.

Two of the 3 can but you can never fully trust a database controlled by another entity, this risk has a cost with large enough dollar amounts that risk becomes non-negligible.

&gt;Yes I get this, which is why I asked what other benefit the scheme has to being fast.

Besides speed, reliability and support there aren't a whole lot of other metrics to measure a financial product on. But this is likely on their Quorum fork of Ethereum so they may be just starting with the fast payment processing to get a foundation to build many other services on.

&gt;I feel like the main difference is just the scale.

In case of payments, the other party you're sending money to has to trust that JPMCoin is really worth a dollar.  Why should they?  Its JPMC's word.  Whereas with XRP, exchanges all over the world have the values of XRP posted publicly.  And even if they do trust JPMC, they need to find someone that can cash out that JPMCoin.  JPMC would have to build an entire ecosystem and get exchanges/banks to pay them for JPMCoins.  Buy why would competitors pay them and share their wealth?  

Ripple isn't a bank.  Its goal is to make sure the XRP ecosystem is vibrant. Ripple has no desire to beat any of these banks at banking.  The more everyone succeeds using XRP, the more its worth.  So in a world where there's a choice between JPMCoin, run by a competitor, or Ripple, who is a neutral 3rd-party, other banks would probably choose Ripple.",2019-02-15 06:11:20,eghlpmw,1,Ripple
cryptojan,"Lots of good answers below to the JPMC FUD against all of Crypto. I think Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, addressed it best though:

According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, bank-backed digital assets are an unrealistic and ‚Äúdeeply misguided‚Äù solution for the industry. When the Utility Settlement Coin was announced, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse penned an op-ed called ‚ÄúThe Case Against BankCoin‚Äù, outlining why he believes bank-backed cryptocurrencies are doomed to fail.

*‚ÄúA bank-issued digital asset can only really efficiently settle between the banks who issued it. Then, two scenarios can play out. Scenario one: all banks around the world put aside competitive and geopolitical differences, adopt the same digital asset, agree on its rules, and harmoniously govern its usage. Fat chance. Scenario two (the more likely scenario): banks not in the issuing group issue their own digital assets with their own sets of rules and governance.*

*We‚Äôre kinda seeing this already, as the* [*FT points out*](https://www.ft.com/content/1a962c16-6952-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c)*, with Citi‚Äôs Citicoin and Goldman Sachs‚Äô SETLcoin. The result would be an even more fragmented currency landscape than what we have today.* ***If banks of different digital asset groups want to settle trades with one another, they‚Äôll have to make markets between their unique digital assets or trade between their digital assets and a common fiat currency.

*The second big problem with* ***the ‚Äòutility settlement coin‚Äô is it seems it‚Äôll be backed by a basket of currencies. Once backed by cash, it‚Äôs no longer an asset; it‚Äôs a liability. Trading liabilities then ultimately requires moving cash across borders, re-creating today‚Äôs system but adding more friction!‚Äù***

According to Garlinghouse, independent digital assets give banks the best shot at truly bringing payment systems into the modern era. And he believes XRP is the digital asset that will make it happen.

*‚ÄúWe strongly believe banks need an independent digital asset to enable truly efficient settlement and we believe XRP is best positioned for that role. It goes back to the fundamentals of what makes digital assets unique and special ‚Äì they‚Äôre universal currencies, meaning anyone can use them as units of value anywhere in the world.

Maybe Alibaba wants to get some potcoins real quick because they see the industry booming. Faster than one could switch tabs, those JPMC tokens that were useless are now potcoins.

c0mrade34,"I'm a recent grad from VESIT. So hold my beer.

&gt; No one would have Somaiya even in their Top 10 entry list of any first 2 Cap Rounds.

Almost everyone nowadays puts Somaiya on their first list. I had gone there during my time when applications were being distributed, filled, accepted. The queues were longer than what you would have seen during demonetisation.

&gt; VESIT has higher cut off for most rounds. CS, IT, EXTC, ETRX. 

Now I won't cross verify this from stupidsid but there were people in my batch who had scored 125 - 130 out of 200 (MT-CET) and still got admitted to CS via CAP rounds for morning batch.

If you talk about Sindhi minority, CS scores were as low as 70s or or even 60s (now this was afternoon batch, not morning). 

&gt; Some chose TSEC over SPIT, for getting to be in Bandra etc.

I had one such Sindhi friend who withdrew his admission from Vesit (CS) to go pursue IT from TSEC instead. He chose to travel from Ulhasnagar to Bandra when he had the option to cut his journey till Kurla. 

So you see 5 - 6 years ago CS / IT was kind of readily gettable here when compared to Somaiya non minority seats (140s, IIRC) well before Somaiya's autonomy. 

&gt; Honestly it's too much of a travel to Vidyavihar from most populated parts of the city like Western Suburbs and Town

Fuck this shit. This is the worst thing about being in VESIT and college can do absolutely nothing about it. Nearest stations - Kurla and Chembur. Both are a good 2.5 to 3 KMs away from the college. Because of the deadly fast moving traffic at the junction of Sion Trombay road, one of my seniors had lost his life. Brain smashed like a fking Bhaji Pav (pillion rider). A teacher riding a rickshaw once had her arm fractured at the same spot due to a near-death accident. Go alone in a rickshaw and pay 35 - 37 rupees each side. Bus stops too aren't available in the immediate vicinity. 

&gt; In terms of placements, it was great as well. Barclay's, SAP Labs, Nomura, Morgan Stanley and other major Product Companies/Investment Banks would come to the other mentioned top colleges and not sure how many of them came to Somaiya. Also Not sure what is the scenario now

If these companies can come to VESIT I know they very well can also go on-campus at KJ. Although SAP, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, JPMC do visit our campus, they return empty-handed at times, or do fine-tuned cherry picking (for a lack of proper word). 

Rest assured almost everyone in CS / IT gets bulk-placed at Accenture / Capgemini / LTI  barring some corner cases. VESIT has a bad blood with TCS &amp; Infosys for god knows what reason. I'll not be surprised if these companies offer higher packages at KJ.

&gt; autonomous stature,

My preference - VJTI. 2nd would be SPIT but could choose KJ, just because I don't have to leave central line.

&gt; Campus, 

Never have visited Bhavan's campus. But Vidyalankar college in Wadala has almost everything you can say a proper modern engineering college infrastructure should have. VESIT is good too but the management has become bit greedy and messed up w the building.

Apart from this all,

VESIT is very very strict about attendance. KJ, don't know.

VESIT students write shit ton of assignments. KJ people do not, that much.

KJ people take their exams early every semester than MU colleges.

KJ people definitely boast of great fests. Celebrities get called and what not. And then there's sad VESIT, our sadist principal tries to minimize students nuisances by threatening to cancel fests. How could you cancel tech and cultural fests? She did not do it but has the audacity to make it happen in the future.

Honourable mentions (VESIT):
- less annual academic fee
- nice crowd (a solid reason to join the college)
- nice pocket friendly canteen food",2019-02-10 06:27:05,eg488qy,1,mumbai

You mean like the credit agencies? Of course you can simulate the blockchain datastructure, it's just a write only ledger, I've literally built an industrial write only ledger before. But you're completely discounting third party risk, which i guess would be forgivable if you're not familiar with the mortgage industry if it didn't in part cause the greatest recession since the great depression. Most of the proposed use cases can be shot down as being better solved by centrally controlled servers, which is why you're parroting the counter, someone smarter than you came up with it and you think you can apply it to every DLT that you don't actually understand. You'd have discounted the internet because we alread have WANs

&gt; which dispenses with the complexity of any sort of distributed ledger and will necessarily be more cost efficient.

Server cost pales in comparison to third party risk, it's not because of fear of server cost that a central ledger for loans doesn't exist.

&gt;Without miners you need some way to secure the network, with financial incentives like Proof Of Stake, if it's public and not permissioned. If it's permissioned or private, a DLT is unnecessary overhead.

Don't explain consensus protocols to me. Proof of stake is possible the future but I wouldn't count out corporate permissioned networks like quorum where all stakeholders would run nodes and have auditable proof of any fuckery by a Sybil attack.

Just go to the hospitals, jpmc , tbcc and you will see tons of foreigners.  I just had 2 teeth extracted by a very young local dentist at rimba dentist yesterday. He was impressive and inspiring. He was assisted by a local assistant too.  And the xray technician was a young local too. I haven't been to the dentist In more than 10 years here.

ChristopherBurr,"25% match is fantastic.  It's a match of total salary, not what you contribute.  In this case it's $33,750 + the $19,000 you're allowed to contribute in 2019 (not $18,500 anymore).   So theoretically you can get $52,750 into your 401K with this company.  I'd say that's great considering:

  \* BofA - 7% match

  \* JPMC - 8%  match

  \* BNP Paribas - 9%  match

retroguy02,"Yes, I agree that doctors who studied on govt seats should sign a return-of-service contracts or pay the fees, no such thing as a free ride (and let's face it, what we call ""taxpayers' money"" in Pakistan is basically borrowed money since 0.5% of the population pays income tax) but your attitude that doctors should be willing to sacrifice everything is ridiculous. Why don't you make the same demands from politicians, army officers and lawyers? Because they have the teeth to bite you right back in the a*s?

&gt;  Those doctors (95%) are not doing anything for humanity. they are getting paid from HUMANITY. OK

Ever been to a govt hospital in Pakistan? Do you know what residents in a government hospital go through, their pay and timings? It's people like you who can afford to go to expensive private hospitals who lecture doctors about how we're evil for charging you burgeois folk instead of being Edhi sahab. I know big-name surgeons who can charge 200k per surgery in places like AKUH and South City (which are made for rich/upper middle class people) do it for free in charity hospitals like Indus and in govt setups like JPMC and NICH even though they don't need to, it's because they want to help. You want someone to blame then blame the govt for the terrible state of our healthcare system. With the exception of some bad apples, most doctors do have the right intentions - otherwise they wouldn't be spending their 20s doing calls for peanuts.

CLons," Copied from another thread:

I  can chime in here, I was a dev at JPMC - IB (Investment Banking) (NJ/NYC) for a  while.    
My experience, your mileage may vary.  


The culture is  serious and steady; the whole dev floor was library quiet.  Dress code  was business casual, very very conservative culture.  Like any firm that  size there are some politicians, however for the most part you simply  need to be only vaguely aware of them, since they don't affect you on a  day to day.  As with any large team as well, you will quickly realize  some people are there to do the work and some people are just along for the ride.

Project wise however, the time lines are aggressive.  We had a new young director he wanted to make a name and climb the ladder, so he  commited the classic blunder of over promising and under delivering.  This resulted in some long nights/weekends come end of quarter and a lot of  stress come deadlines or quarter close.

On the benefits side life is good.  An internal email nets you some  perks:  Free, no charge ever, premier checking + savings accounts (10k  Min balance waived).  Employee rates for auto loans + refinancing (You  credit tier + 1 generally).  Some standard rate type stuff (Discount for  Verizon / AT&amp;T phone plans (28% for me!) , slight discounts for car  rentals, hotels, etc.).

Work and pay-wise: they are not shy about asking you to work  overtime, sometimes upwards of 60-80 hours a week (Read: Quarter Close  again), however this seems like more of the manager's poor planning than was typical.  Salary was fairly  decent, vets made reasonably competitive salary + benefits.

At a technical level, a lot of the work we did was DB /  Automation scripting / Java / Oracle / TM1 / Some Batch.  Corp utilizes an EP model (Enterprise Planning) that waterfalls down into the branches,  who take their sections and load them on a monthly BD (Business Day)  Cycle.  Running, bug fixing, error hunting this system is most of the  work we did.  I am sure it's different branch to branch.

**TL;DR**:  Good pay + Benefits, long hours, aggressive timelines. ",2019-01-23 22:38:48,eernu7o,2,cscareerquestions
fastandsimple,"While moving to another state is always a big move, you can always come back or apply to the ""big boys"" later when you're not satisfied. You won't get stuck in JPMC simply because you can always leave. People /might/ get stuck on a specific stack, but not at a job. 

I interviewed at JPMC in Houston. From what they told me, they want people changing teams every year, like, the company wants you to. I eventually didn't get the job, but the company seemed... okay. It's a famous company, so at least your resume will look better for it, and definitely not worse. 

The only problem I see with this is that you hate the job a month in and want to change. You decide to go apply at some company in SF and get an offer, but now you have to break your lease in OH. You can avoid this problem by either 1. not getting a long-term lease (best case would finding something month-to-month) or 2. just stick with the job for at least a year.

* Non-technical people in charge of technical processes and blocking approvals for stupid reasons while letting horrible plans go right through

snowzach,"From my 10 years experience there, assuming you're talking about JPMC, the IC bonus doesn't generally change year over year. If you perform well, it's basically the same as the year before or maybe + a percent or two especially in 3 year. To get a major change your management will have to go to bat for you as usually there is a fixed pool of raise money and to get anything decent, they have to fight with all the other managers for it for IC and raises which means you need to outshine your peers. My suggestion is, when setting your goals for the year, tell them you want to get to the 603 grade. What do I need to do? The place is huge and you have to be your own advocate. I would recommend making a list of EVERYTHING you do, especially when you go above and make sure it's all listed on your review because if your manager goes to bat for you and he has a bullet list of your extra accomplishments when he's fighting with other managers it will go to your favor. If you just work extra hard it will get lost in the noise a lot of times. We used to joke that screwing up real bad was good for your career because the upper management would know your name and forget it was associated with something bad. It's just the reality of working for a company that huge. The upside is, the job is incredibly stable, and generally the pay and benefits are pretty good. I can tell you that the pay range there can be huge for the same job so chances are you're in the middle of the range as 100k is pretty good money.",2019-01-17 12:36:31,ee92lyw,1,ColumbusIT

The ones I'm really keeping an eye on are the senior officials who came from the private sector. I feel they can bring a fresh perspective and were not brought up in the cubersome beuracracy of the public sector. However, their numbers are limited as the government will very rarely take someone from the private sector. Nonetheless, this list includes Dato Amin (Singapore for 6 years, although was in public sector before that), the minister of energy, Manpower industry (from Shell Global - was in London), minister of health (Jpmc) and one of permanent secretary in MEMI(from Shell Global - was in Europe)

&gt;MPRT targeted for $1.8 billion of revenue from primary industry by 2020. I hope MPRT can achieve that.

I wouldn't set my hopes too high on these government targets. Very rarely do they actually meet them and most of the times, they are hilariously off target. But nonetheless, Dato Ali does have a good reputation from what I hear. Will it translate to tangible results? We will have to see. Haven't been too impressed so far by their policies so far. 

&gt;For Amin Liew's MOFT , I only see from the recent BruPay initiative by the AMBD and the new Brunei-China One Belt One Road Association. so ye, nth nda ku tau

Yea so far we haven't seen much. The FDI joint ventures such as Hengyi are under him, so we'll see how successful these are.  The Brunei-China one belt association thing is an independent private sector initiative. It has no relations to the MOFE - he was just the guest of honour for it.

ryzvonusef,"&gt; KARACHI: 
&gt; At an intercity bus stand in Saddar, a passenger asked, ‚ÄúIs there any toilet?‚Äù  Shaking his head, the booking clerk suggested the elderly man urinate in front of a wall on the main road. The man who was travelling to Rahim Yar Khan had no other option but to relieve himself in front of the wall, ignoring the message written on it, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt urinate here.‚Äù  This incident occurred a day before the ‚ÄúWorld Toilet Day‚Äù which is observed on November 19.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThere is no public toilet at this bus stand. I am travelling with my family. A man can compromise if nature calls. But what about female passengers?‚Äù said a retired professor, who was waiting for his bus.  ‚ÄúThey have only one toilet for staff, which is also locked. Where should we go?‚Äù he lamented.
&gt; 
&gt; The world observes ‚ÄúWorld Toilet Day‚Äù today [Monday] in order to tackle global sanitation crises, but unfortunately it is has been the least of priorities for our successive governments.
&gt; 
&gt; The World Bank‚Äôs latest report, ‚ÄòWhen water becomes a hazard‚Äô revealed that the management of drains and treatment of human waste is nonexistent for most rural dwellers in Pakistan and that poor conditions also prevail in small towns and cities. There has been almost no effort by the public sector to regulate the presence of sanitation facilities or monitor water quality. As a result, there is a huge variation in the quality of latrines built.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúMore than 82% of households are not connected to any drainage system and generate stagnant pools of sewage near dwelling areas in villages,‚Äù states the report, referring to Sindh. ‚ÄúEven where drains exist, majority are open drains with no treatment of effluents. Under such conditions, untreated fecal waste water seeps into ground water aquifers or drains into surface water, polluting both,‚Äù it adds. According to the report, ‚Äúfecal sludge also contaminates the soil. Virtually no investment has been made in the management of fecal sludge or waste water.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; Deplorable conditions
&gt; ----
&gt; Karachi, a metropolitan city and the economic hub of the country, lacks public toilets in most public places. Where public toilets do exist, often women and disabled persons are deprived of the facility.  An example can be taken from Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC), one of the largest public hospitals of Pakistan, which is also lacking in this facility. ‚ÄúOnly two public toilets exist in the hospital and one remains closed after 5pm,‚Äù said an official who works at the hospital. ‚ÄúHundreds of people visit the hospital every day. The condition of the majority of toilets in hospital wards is pathetic. The patients and attendants have no other option, but to use overflowing toilets,‚Äù he added.
&gt; 
&gt; These days, public toilets near Lucky Star in Saddar remain closed due to shortage of water. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use their toilets, but it has been closed for the last two days. There is shortage of water,‚Äù said a man who runs a shop in front of the public toilets. ‚ÄúThe government has built and handed them over to a third party. They charge Rs10 per visit but despite taking money, the toilets are not sanitary,‚Äù he added.
&gt; 
&gt; Although the World Bank in its report said that the situation in urban areas of Pakistan is better, things are far from adequate.  ‚ÄúOverall, urban Punjab and urban Sindh have greater access to covered underground drains as compared to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,‚Äù reads the report. ‚ÄúIn urban Punjab, 59% of households had access to underground or covered drains, 35% used open drains, and 5% had no access to drains. In urban Sindh, 68% of households were connected to underground or covered drains, 28% used open drains, and 4% had no access to drains,‚Äù states the report.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Nadeem Ahmed, a water and sanitation expert, various countries are now making an effort to improve the situation, but Pakistan still has a long way to go when it comes to sanitation.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúDrinking water, health and the food chain is attached with sanitation. Sindh relies mostly on flush toilets connected to open drains and pit latrines,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe distance of the household‚Äôs water source from the toilet becomes an important factor in determining source contamination. Most people drain human waste in agricultural land. So nothing is hygienic,‚Äù said Ahmed.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; Efforts under way
&gt; ----
&gt; The Strengthening Participatory Organisation (SPO) with the help of WaterAid Pakistan has started a campaign to mobilise lawmakers on water, sanitation and hygiene.
&gt; 
&gt; SPO Regional Coordinator Raheema Panhwar, told The Express Tribune that safe sanitation is a basic human right and is central to eradicating extreme poverty. ‚ÄúPakistan is among the world‚Äôs 36 most water stressed counties in the world. Two out of every five schools are missing a toilet.‚Äù said Panhwar. ‚ÄúAround 23% of households have a garbage collection system in Pakistan. You can get a sense about the importance of sanitation in our country from this,‚Äù she added.
&gt; 
&gt; Panhwar added that 25 million people in Pakistan defecate in the open, making Pakistan the 9th in the top ten countries in the world in this regard. ‚ÄúAround 88% of diarrhoeal disease in Pakistan is attributed to unsafe water supply, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.  79m people in Pakistan lack decent sanitation and about 92% of the wastewater is untreated and goes directly to water bodies,‚Äù she said.
&gt; 
&gt; There is however, some good news in the making. The Sindh government has developed a 10-year multi-sectorial ‚ÄòSindh Strategic Sector Plan 2016-2026 Drinking water, Sanitation and Hygiene‚Äô to provide better sanitation services in province.  In this regard, the provincial government has notified ‚ÄòSindh Sanitation Policy 2017‚Äô that aims for 100% eradication of open defecation in the Sindh province, and people will have access to use sanitary latrines by 2025. ‚ÄúThe sanitation policy is meant to develop a ‚ÄòNeat and Clean Sindh‚Äô,‚Äù said the Excise, Taxation and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla. He said that the government has allocated around Rs21 billion in the provincial Annual Development Plan (ADP) and Rs5b in the district scheme to revamp water and sanitation issues.",2018-11-19 13:10:45,ea0ntrx,1,pakistan

First I read the collapse of Bear Sterns was because of their massive short position on silver, which JPMC inherited along with some supposed immunity to short the market for 10 years while fixing the recession.

While you can take that with a grain of salt, while they were shorting the market they went from 0 oz of Silver to building the largest above ground vault physical holdings.

BruneiMostKepoh,"JPMC - took about a week ish. Cost wise - you‚Äôve got 2 options; traditional braces which is about $3,500 or the Damon / ceramics which is about $4,500. Process is pretty simple and straight forward. Give them a call first and check when you‚Äôre able to come in for a consultation. They‚Äôll let you know immediately when‚Äôs the nearest date available. Once that‚Äôs set, you meet your Dentist, then he‚Äôll give you his recommendation on what needs to be done. If you agree then first step is to make your teeth mould and X-Ray. These would be separate charges and you‚Äôd be looking at around $280.

After that depending on your braces that you wanna choose, your payments will be $300 monthly for the first 6 months followed by $100 monthly (payable after your monthly checkups) till everything is settled. You can also opt to do a down payment first and jump right into paying $100 monthly. 

Cheap option would be government. But you‚Äôd most likely will be put on a 2 years wait list. And you‚Äôd also need to beat the crowd and wait to get your number first to get a consultation. If you‚Äôre willing to wait and don‚Äôt wanna spend a lot of money, then this is the only feasible option which most Bruneians opt for. 

Alternatively, a number of Bruneians also get theirs braces done in Miri. Cost is about RM 4,500. The downside is you will have to find time to make a monthly trip for your appointments. And also for emergency cases i.e if your braces come off or breaks, you‚Äôd have to drop everything and zoom down to Miri.",2018-11-11 02:04:27,e9fjn01,1,Brunei

You also may need to register to JPMC first with $10 fee.

On the appointment date, the doctor will check the condition of your teeth, the braces treatment packages, the estimated duration and the fees. 

Fees can be paid by installment. $300 for the first 6 months, then follow by $100 each month until your braces is taken off.

If your AGREE with the doctor‚Äôs consultation, advise and fees, they will set appointments for the first 6 months. Please bear in mind, these appointments will not be that soon. 

I had to wait for 1 year for my turn after my initial appointment. My braces cost $4,200 for 2.5yrs. Their services were excellent. My attending doctor is Dr.James Sunny.

ScatfuckCumfart,"How will the poor fare in the event of bank runs? It's the people who live month-to-month who are the most impacted by employers not being able to meet payroll. When institutional banks go insolvent, they cause a tidal wave of human misery and the lower/middle classes are hurt the most because they don't have large cushions of savings.

The directors at a bank would fight to keep from going under to protect their stock options, sure, but they also won't have to change their lifestyle much to live on their savings for a while until they find a new job. Owners/investors of banks are ironically LESS dependent on their business's solvency than the working-class people who rely on its operations.

You must not be aware of how the housing crash bailouts went down. The government essentially commanded the solvent institutions (JPMC/BofA) to bail out (acquire) the insolvent ones like Bear. If the Treasury didn't step in and command them to do so, they would've preferred to let them fail naturally and move in for the market share on their own terms. But that would've caused more human misery via mass layoffs and bank runs (and let the markets return to normalized price levels), so instead the Treasury sec called meetings with all the bank heads to divvy up of the corpse of Bear et al. to make sure that the debtholders they were absorbing would be taken care of with minimal interruption to the cashflow they were relying on to pay for their mortgage. Then the Fed continued engorging the markets with cheap cash to try to stimulate growth, and the next round of global-scale malinvestment began anew.",2018-10-30 00:14:41,e8o494x,1,ANormalDayInRussia

&gt;  heard JP Morgan's SEP internship was revamped recently, so maybe the projects/etc. have been more interesting/competitive?  
  
Wouldn't count too much on that. AFAIK it's mostly just a public-facing re-branding to show that it is in fact a software development internship (in the past, the Technology Analyst Program also included BAs and IT and other techy stuff, but I think they've been moved to other programs in recent years).

rharrington31,"Welcome to Delaware! I also grew up and went to college in NJ before moving here. I was similarly unfamiliar with the area, but have really come to love it.

I made [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Delaware/comments/74oz5j/renting_in_wilmington/do09c2h/) about a year ago that I think might be helpful for you.

&gt; Zillow does a nice job showing boundaries. They're not perfect, but work well enough.
&gt; 
&gt; * [Trolley Square](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/Trolley-Square-Wilmington-DE_rb/?fromHomePage=true&amp;shouldFireSellPageImplicitClaimGA=false&amp;fromHomePageTab=rent) - typically somewhat younger crowd, generally in their 20s. Very short walk to some fast casual restaurants (Opa Opa, El Diablo, etc.) and bars/restaurants (Oyster House, Trolley Tap House, Toscana, etc.). I really consider Trolley to extend to N. Union St., contrary to what Zillow says. The area is generally quite safe.
&gt; * [Cool Springs](https://www.zillow.com/homes/cool-springs-Wilmington-DE_rb/) - Further walk from all of the restaurants, etc. in the Trolley Square area. You also need to cross Pennsylvania Ave/Rt. 52 to get there, which can be busy at certain times of day. Older population. Rent is generally cheaper than in Trolley. The area is pretty safe, though borders on some less than ideal areas.
&gt; * [Forty Acres](https://www.zillow.com/homes/forty-acres-Wilmington-DE_rb/) - Similar walking distances to bars/restaurants as Cool Springs. There's a wider range of homes available here, up to million dollar listings. Generally older and quieter. I would consider it very safe.
&gt; * [19806](https://www.zillow.com/homes/Wilmington-DE-19806_rb/) - the broader area. Generally everything in 19806 is going to be pretty safe. I would personally be willing to live in basically every section of this zip code.
&gt; 
&gt; In terms of crime, the general rule of thumb that I use is the closer to 4th St. you get, the more crime you'll find. I've found that, anecdotally, 7th St. tends to be the line where I go from feeling safe to not.
&gt; 
&gt; Other areas to consider are the [Wilmington Riverfront](https://www.zillow.com/homes/Riverfront-Wilmington-DE_rb/) and [Downtown Wilmington](https://www.zillow.com/homes/Downtown-Wilmington-DE_rb/), though they have a very different feel from the Trolley Square area.

It's worth mentioning that in the year since I wrote that, Downtown Wilmington has really started to grow. Quite a few new restaurants have opened up (Stitch House, Margaux, Bardea, Farmer &amp; the Cow, etc.).

In terms of finding apartments, I've always had luck with Zillow and Craigslist. If you're looking in the Trolley Square area, the apartment buildings that tend to come up on searches are 1303 Delaware Ave ([PARQ at the Square](https://www.liveparqnow.com/)) and the [Mayfair Apartments](https://www.zillow.com/b/the-mayfair-apartments-wilmington-de-5XkJGV/). These are perfectly okay options, but I'd personally recommend finding a row home with roommates instead. It ends up being cheaper and you have a nicer living situation.

In terms of timing around a search, I always found apartments are advertised anywhere from 4-8 weeks ahead of the potential move-in date. With that being said, you can certainly find places with shorter/longer lead times than that. Anecdotally, the neighborhoods that I listed above tend to have the most listings open up during the summer.

One last thing for you to consider - JPMC has a few locations in Delaware. You might want to figure out which one specifically you'll be placed at.",2018-10-19 00:49:19,e80axjt,4,Delaware

Kaeladen,"Hey there,

I just attended the Code for Good Tampa event this past weekend after applying (and interviewing) for their SWE summer internship a month ago, so I sorta fit in the same shoes here. 

From what I gathered, if you did poorly on your interview, attending CFG gives you a second chance to impress the engineers there. My friend got an online interview before the event and had their on-site be expedited / replaced by CFG after they discovered she would be attending.

At best, you get a call back regardless on if you attend or not. At worst, you just get some jackathon experience and a chance to get your application boosted depending on your performance at CFG. 

It's entirely up to you, and if you have the ability to attend without inconvenience like flying across the country for it, I'd do it if you want to solidify your connection to JPMC.",2018-10-09 05:56:07,e7f036t,4,cscareerquestions

MoonNoon,"I already covered those things. The signing up part is if JPMC offers that service. Sure people are free to not use it but most wont be managing their own LN. Also I mentioned layer 3. And KYC. I explained it out in the previous comments. These are questions I have on my own based on what I know about the LN. Maybe you can explain to me how you imagine the LN will look like fully deployed.

The small payments doesn‚Äôt make economic sense when fees are $100 for on chain tax. I also hear proponents say you‚Äôll never have to settle. You say it‚Äôs the point but it makes no sense at all. It looks from my point of view that you are the one parroting points. ",2018-10-06 11:48:11,e798iu0,1,btc
MoonNoon,"&gt; Sure but I'm not sure why you would connect to that node then. 

Because you want to spend your money at multiple location without having to open a channel to each one. I'm just saying they will make you weigh out your options of whether to connect to JPMC but 95% of people will be okay with just signing up with KYC JPMC ""LN"" service and giving up control of their money. 

&gt; I mean listen, if the point of bitcoin is to be a decentralized private immutable cryptocurrency a company like Starbucks probably wouldnt use Bitcoin.

Sorry, you lost me here. What you said is the point of bitcoin to me. Except privacy but there are workarounds to that. Starbucks wouldn't until it's on the cusp of becoming the de facto currency because of their large size but there are coffee shops that do accept crypto.

&gt; I think I am painting a picture of how the world uses lightning network. I think your just confused with that picture. What your saying is black and white. If a merchant like starbucks is required to know who their customers are at all, which at this time they dont, ie cash, then only crypto that is complaint with kyc/aml is acceptable in their eyes. This scenario plays out exactly for Bitcoin Cash unless they too want to be completely compliant with kyc/aml.

I think Starbucks will just outsource their LN process to a company like JPMC just like they do for credit cards. I suppose they and every company could start their own LN hub and do that but companies generally outsource most things that aren't in their core business model. I could totally be wrong but I just think it's unlikely to happen. KYC doesn't for miners because they don't transmit money, like the other guy said. Only keep records of how much was sent by addresses and don't actually hold funds.

It seems we just have differing views. I really appreciate your input.

MoonNoon,"&gt; Nodes can be anonymous. As I understand it when you make a lightning payment you pay the person next in line for the hops.

I get that but what happens when the gov tell JPMC to connect to nodes that are not anonymous and have identified themselves. Unless you think JPMC will run LN nodes anonymously.

&gt; In your example your individual funds would need to be held by the ""hub"". Which is not how it works.

If the user used JPMC's centralized layer 3. But even if not, JPMC can deny connections from anonymous hubs. So, if I wanted to use their well connected hub I will have to register with them and identify myself and my connection so that they can track me. Is that not a possibility?

MoonNoon,I can see that happening when JPMC is the one that created the wallet. If it's routed by the wallet I don't see how it scales to millions (billions) of users because the wallet can't keep track of all the channel states in the LN. Unless you connect to a superhub.,2018-10-06 04:46:29,e78ka6s,1,btc
MoonNoon,"How can you say that with any certainty? How do you imagine a fully deployed, functioning LN for retail payments to be?

Say there's JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) LN service. A user signs up to their service (perhaps they open their account using fiat - they use fiat because BTC fees are $100 USD equivalent of BTC which many Core devs say they are fine with) and uses JPMC's channels. The user will not have to settle because either they can't afford it or JPMC's hub is so huge that the user's preferred stores are also within JPMC's hub. Essentially a JPMC centralized layer 3 where JPMC manages the user's funds on top of the LN.

The scenario above is the path I currently see LN taking. I honestly don't see every user managing their channels and watchtowers with Raspberry Pies. I'm interested in how you think it will be? Please let me know if I have a fundamental misunderstanding anywhere.

I worked in Commodities derivatives in 2008. I now work in exotic derivatives in 2018. Let's just say that so much has change that makes a financial meltdown of the same nature as 2018 almost impossible. 

1) Regulations that have been adopted by the FCA, ECB and SEC have basically forced banks to keep cash reserves. Two examples of such regulations are Basel III and Solvency II. 10% AtL ratios and 10% DtA ratio's ensure we don't have another Lehmanns/Bear Stearns moment. They were on 4% and 2% respectively. Furthermore, stress testing is done so rigorously nowdays that if you fail it automatically gets flagged. No bulge bracket IB has failed since 2013 other than Deutsche. And we all know Deutsche are in the shit so that was to be expected. 

2) From the area in which I work, everything is regulated to the bricks now. Clearing houses could clear an OTC derivative in 30 minutes, now it takes 3 hours. Half the products no longer exist. Market makers such as ourselves have limits in the premiums we can set, the liabilities we can offer and as such the direction has switched from ""High risk high reward"" to ""Little risk slightly more reward"" Things such as Mifid II come in that basically protects both the private and institutional investor from feduciaries such as ourselves from directly acting against client interests.  

3) The myth that Gordon brown held no responsibility for 2008 is such bullshit.

Redditfc555,"I recommend ViTaLiV HWC clinic, if possible ask to meet Dato Zulkarnain. But I‚Äôm not sure if he still come to clinic or not just check with receptionist. He save my son from almost lose the hearing ~10 yr ago. Luckily my colleague recommend me to this clinic when I complaint about my son condition wasn‚Äôt improve at all from one of private clinic in Kiulap even already refer the case to Ripas. Private clinic prescribe him got infection but after few months on antibiotic still not improve then I asked him to give us letter to Ripas. And yes, we have to wait for few months to see specialist. At Ripas we go through 3 difference specialist which were gave different opinion. We waste time nearly a year cause each time gap of visit is every few months. 1st Dr. (Foreigner) said there is a growth inside his nose. 2nd (foreigner) said he got tonsillitis and need to do  operation soon. 3nd (Bruneian) said oh! he is fine nothing to worry about. Sadly none of 3 specialist we met never ask my son to do hearing test at all although the room just next to their office. By seek 2nd opinion from Dr. Zul, he observe my son right away at first that something not right about his hearing.  And ask my son to do hearing test at RIPAS for couple of sessions. At that time his clinic not yet has facility for this. But I think they do have now. My son eventually got surgery to remove the growth from the noses and insert grommet inside the ear. The surgery done at JPMC.  And Yes, the cost wise is very expensive but we think is worth for the rest of his life. It took &lt; 2 hr. Surgery but it was magical when my son woke up he has no more pain and he can hear very well. I still remember the next day when he got discharge he become almost completely a very happy boy after being sad - miserable looking boy for over a year. ",2018-09-01 07:37:02,e56ou4m,12,Brunei

DontMentionWombats,"Thanks for the long thoughtful reply.

&gt; I think we see a lot of financial scandals in the US because we are a big country with a big economy and and huge finance industry. 

The EU has approximately the same GDP as the US; I don't have exact figures on it but purely from observation I think the number of problems has been similar - as have been the number of prosecutions and the magnitude of fines.  Maybe that's confirmation bias or these not being uncovered as thoroughly, but you tell me.

As far as ""foreign firms"" - I don't buy that.  Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS, and the likes are as established in the US as any large American bank, fully SEC and Fed regulated.  While the US has prosecuted these organizations for crimes committed outside US jurisdiction, those committed on US soil (e.g. Birkenfeld) were as domestic as the worst that JPMC or Wells Fargo could come up with.  And the list of US domiciled banks committing fraud and similar crimes is pretty significant.

&gt;  it's also common sense. 

I disagree on this.  If there is a risk of ""playing cat and mouse"" it's a defect in the prosecutorial/judicial system (juries e.g.) more than anything else.

&gt; The reason that Americans are suspicious are for different reasons than that.

No, I named a specific instance - the reasons for distrust were very clear.

&gt; This is really troubling for Americans because the structure looks corrupt.

This is the result of a lack of understanding of European regulatory processes.  The difference is that especially in northern European countries, there is far less of an adversarial, distrustful relationship with government entities.

&gt; This inquisitorial system looks like a broken process to us.

This may well be what it looks like to Americans - to Europeans, it looks like US firms evading taxes (granted, due to shitty European tax laws and loopholes that are only  now being fixed).

And it's not ""inquisitorial"" - it's Napoleonic law as opposed to common law.

&gt; The reason they paid so much was because under US law there was a formula that provided the penalty

I am absolutely fine with this.  Again, clear definitions.

&gt; there is no real incentive for the US to shake down these foreign banks. We don't need the money 

Money is always an incentive.  I do not for a second believe this.  The fact that the US elects prosecutors is something I find absolutely baffling - you alluded to perverse motivations by Vestager and yet you have this system?  Wow

&gt; Notice how these are all American banks paying these fines, not foreign ones?

Yes, it's not mentioned fines, for example a 4.9bn settlement by RBS.  The reason I linked to the article was not about the specific organizations - and it does give the lie to it being mainly ""foreign banks"" doing the badness.

What I find worse is the hypocrisy - I used to live in Chile and was approached by a major American bank offering me basically an private offshore account for tax evasion, in Puerto Rico...for a minimum deposit of $25k.  This around the time when the US government was again going after Swiss banks.  I don't know what's worse...the clear attempt to undermine a sovereign state's tax law, the belief that they could get away with it because the US doesn't care what happens in other countries as long as they get theirs...or how cheap they were selling themselves for.

&gt; but firms do not have to settle. The choose to. 

The point is that it's basically a Hobson's choice - grand jury investigations and indictments holding the potential to be enough to torpedo a firm.  I see parallels to the American criminal justice system and how prosecutors pressure suspects to take plea bargains because they'll ruin them in front of a jury if they try to fight even an unjust accusation.

For interviews at places like GS and JPMC, you'll need a suit and tie. But one suit/tie/shirt outfit is all you need. A Macy's or similar level of suit is fine. Fit is much more important to looking professional than price.

 For day-to-day work outfits, you may need to dress anywhere between casual (jeans and tee) to business professional, it depends on the company and office. But don't worry, if you do end up working at these places, they pay out a signing bonus (at least a couple thousand) you can use to build your wardrobe before you start. Again, fit is more important than price. And build your wardrobe gradually. There's no need to buy 10 dress shirts all at once.

Ultimately, JC is choice casual so I don't think you would run afoul of company policy if you dressed down.

I think it's easier for me as a full time employee than as an intern to make a dress decision like that because the status of future employment for you guys is not as clear as it is once the contract is signed.

PragmaticSquirrel,"In your opinion- would it be fine if stores had ‚Äúno Jews allowed‚Äù signs?

My honest reaction- government should always stand up at least a It for the little guy. Jews, LGBT, etc are all minorities of the population.

The ‚Äúfree market‚Äù has many times throughout recent history failed to punish business who show bigotry towards certain minority groups. An example today would be reverse redlining- which was at least happening in the last 15 years, and looks likely to still be happening today. The banks that were found to be practicing reverse redlining in the 2000‚Äôs (Wells fargo, B of A, Suntrust) lost no business over it. And those are the ones who‚Äôs court cases have completed. There are current cases against Citi, JPMC/ Chase, BMO, etc. virtually every major bank.

It seems the free market will really only punish companies for views held by the majority of the population.

50% more likely to be stopped for ‚Äúno reason‚Äù while driving, 250% more likely to be searched without consent (whites 30% more likely to have contraband), 50% more likely to be arrested vs warned, 15% more likely to be offered a plea deal with prison time (vs community service time served etc), 20% more likely to be convicted, and serve 10% longer sentences. All studies behind these #‚Äôs control for what you‚Äôd expect- geography income priors circumstances of arrest specific charges etc.

Fun fact- if you multiply out all those factors from stopped on the street to convicted, it ends up being roughly 675% (1.5 * 2.5 * 1.5 * 1.2) more likely that a random black person (vs white person) goes from legally driving their car to prison. Eerily close to that 700% more likely to be exonerated.

Here‚Äôs one on driving stops and searches from Minnesota:

https://www.twincities.com/2016/07/08/data-dive-racial-disparities-in-minnesota-traffic-stops/

Numbers are higher than what I quoted.

Another from Vermont:

http://digital.vpr.net/post/study-spotlights-dangers-driving-while-black-and-brown-vermont#stream/0

Again, numbers higher than what I quoted. Both of these are localizing and control for obvious factors (geo, reason for stop, etc).

Both cover- stops, searches, and contraband found.


I wrote this a while back saving the stats from this WaPo study:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/

In which the stats are in line with my claims- rather than much worse, as in those two studies.

On arrests:

https://www.twincities.com/2016/07/13/st-anthony-police-data-shows-disproportionate-arrests-of-blacks/

Again, data is worse than what I claimed. Whites are roughly 3.5x as likely to be let off with a warning vs arrested. Data I was using was more conservative. Here‚Äôs another study in line with the data I posted:

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00230.x

Plea deals:

https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/247227.pdf



On convictions, here you go:

http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar01/jurorbias.aspx

https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-racial-bias-among-jurors-death-penalty-cases

Once again- numbers are even worse than what I claimed.

Here‚Äôs another fun one- white victims made the defendant 2x more likely to be convicted, vs minority victims. Let criminals go free! As long as the victims were black.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615300642


Here‚Äôs the original sentencing study I was referencing:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/16/black-men-sentenced-to-more-time-for-committing-the-exact-same-crime-as-a-white-person-study-finds/

On sentencing- Florida is among the worst. Depending on county and crime, blacks getting anywhere from 1.1x to 2.2x the sentence- same crime priors and circumstances. This is *after* the Florida legislature passed a points system to be used by judges in sentencing- to fight racial disparity. Judges are basically ignoring it.

http://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/sentencing/

And finally, exoneration:

https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf

Blacks 7x more likely to be wrongfully convicted/ exonerated for murder.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

What‚Äôs fun, is that Before the current justice system was formed... we had Jim Crow. And before that- slavery.

In all of its glorious ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù history, the US has always been systematically oppressive of the black minority.

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgovernment vs private industry‚Äù issue.

It‚Äôs the core fabric of our culture. The label or specific institution is irrelevant.

WhoTooted,"\&gt; The government is not solely responsible for the '08 crash. They have part, but I do not buy that they alone caused it. The crash was caused by several things, one of which was the fed keeping interest rates down. 

I agree with this. 

\&gt; The government didn't ""guarantee"" the banks (until the bailouts after the crash), this is an incorrect assessment. 

No, they didn't. But that's not what I said. I said they guaranteed the loans that they made, which is true. Specifically, the government sponsored entities (GSEs), at the mandate of the government, guaranteed residential mortgages made by the banks. 

\&gt; The government removed regulations preventing them from selling ""low risk"" securities made from bundles of subprime mortgages. 

No, they didn't. I'm not sure what regulation you think was ever in place to keep banks from selling MBSs which include subprime mortgages. Hopefully you don't mean Glass-Steagal, because that has nothing to do with MBSs or CDOs. 

\&gt; The banks gave mortgages to people who should not have been given them because they could turn around, bundle these up, and sell them to investors to offset the risk of the mortgages.  

Yes, and many of these (roughly half) came with government guarantees, so they didn't appear very risky to investors. 

\&gt; Investors trusted the banks because of their AAA financial ratings given to them by credit rating agencies (Moody's and S&amp;P), neither of which are government agencies. They clearly should not have been given the ratings that they were. 

In hindsight, they shouldn't have come with those ratings. I agree that the rating agencies played a major role in the crisis. However, many of these securities were backed by government guarantees, so it is understandable that some of them would have received AAA ratings. 

\&gt; TLDR: The government had a hand in causing the financial crisis, mostly by deregulating the amount of risk that financial institutions were subject to, but saying that the government ""told the banks that they would guarantee loans"" is not accurate. 

Deregulation was not a top three role the government played in the financial crisis. The repeal of Glass-Steagal had very little to do with the financial crisis. \*All\* of the institutions which failed were not subject to Glass-Steagal. Many of the institutions which left the crisis healthiest \*were\* subject to Glass-Steagal (JPMC, BOA after they bought Merril-Lynch). ",2018-07-18 21:27:26,e2lnpj9,3,JoeRogan

1tswh4t3v3r,"Absolutely.  So I worked at either BofA/JPMC/WF in the Miami Retail Market as a banker (read: lowly salesman). While working there for 3 full years, I worked in multiple branches in multiple sides of town.  My comments are half based on this experience and also my personal philosophy when it comes to reward and incentives.  As a banker, our jobs consist of 2 pieces, 1 being a salesman for the bank and 2 being a ""spy"" for the Government.  The salesman part is pretty self explanatory if you have been at a bank and had them sell you on products.  The second part most people dont realize unless they have worked in banking or are very familiar with the Bank Secrecy Act.  Pretty much whenever you walk into a bank, bankers and tellers are supposed to profile and probe you with questions to ascertain whether your current behavior/patterns match your overall profile.  This is done for purposes of anti money laundering.  As bankers opening accounts, we are responsible for the accounts we opened, so we go to multiple annual trainings on how to spot suspicious behavior, ways to probe without being too nosey, how to spot suspicious account activity, etc.  With that being said and having worked in the ""poor side"" of Miami (pretty much everything west of I95 would be considered poor until you hit Doral or Kendall), I would sit with mothers who would open accounts for their pending IRS return.  The standard questions to ask when opening bank accounts would be any form of the following: where do you work? What is your source of funds? What are your typical expenses? Where else do you bank? Do you use credit cards? How do you plan to use this account? Etc.  What always baffled me was how content these women were being dirt poor and how they prioritized the things in their life.  No job, not looking for a job, multiple kids from different fathers, just overall terrible situation and content with the situation. This was very sad however I stopped caring when I realized that these people tended to not even want help.  They want money with no strings attached.  This is not to say they all make terrible decisions or dont want help, however to the people who want to get on the right path, maybe some guidance from someone who can help them would be better than a 12k check.

Poor people are absolutely entitled to all enjoyments, as anyone is.  They are entitled to make poor decisions with their money, just like I or anyone else would be, my main issue is that they do not earn this money and the method/timing of dispersement only encourage poor behavior. So I object to the blind payment of money to people who make poor choices, in the hope that this money will be spent wisely or help their situation. ",2018-07-11 01:56:17,e252s8n,0,videos
AccessDeniedx,"Well the position is with JPMC's commercial banking sector. I am thinking it could be a good role to pad the resume if I plan to seek future CFO opportunities. Reason being is because I have the financial reporting experience from years of public accounting (external audit), then this position would kinda ""round me out"" since it is more risk based/internal auditing...especially considering it is the largest bank in the US and forefront of current technology and trends...which are said to be key characteristics CEOs look for in a CFO.

Also I imagine due to the growing trend of blockchain and fintech in the commercial banking industry, this type of role would help me stand out for future opportunities in any industry, not just banking, since most businesses engage in commercial banking one way or another.

I've been researching this all day now. There's no clear cut path to CFO, but I am still under the impression that an Audit Manager role with B4 in an industry I'm more interested in pursuing would still be more beneficial at this point compared to a Senior Auditor role with JPMC Commercial Banking, even if the pay is the same.",2018-07-10 08:38:45,e23gl4w,1,Accounting

Halcyon18,"I typically would not include an address, maybe just leave it to city and state, but you don't want to mistakenly limit yourself geographically, in the event someone interprets that as a limitation to where you want to be. If it is though, maybe include.

For the sake of saving space, I would first reduce the job experience portions, which I will try and include some revisions below and then probably exclude the portion about projects and the skills and activities: Particularly the interests section; no one really cares what you're interested in, particularly in finance and they especially won't care that you would like to backpack Europe and enjoy Fantasy sports (should be expected almost lol) and of course Golf is expected as well. Good info to cut out and display as you interact with colleagues and mentors, who will ultimately be the people you are working with daily. 

The activities could probably be grouped in with the education section. The technical skills probably too, all included within the relevant coursework/skills or something. Relevant coursework should be pretty well-known and could probably be removed, considering you are nearing graduation (this IMO would be more applicable to a sophomore/junior who has not reached their upper level courses but still want to show they have started to develop an understanding. Given you experience, you should have plenty of knowledge.

1) The first bullet point under JPMC is probably not necessary, the reader should understand you were selected if you are including it and its a very generic statement of the role anyway. The other details provide a more detailed explanation.

2) JPMC Bullet 2 - I imagine JPMS is JP Morgan Securities, LLC, but a reader may not know since you do not reference JPMS previously, only JPMC. Maybe reword to ""Settled trades for the Fixed Income division, in addition to providing support to the CIO Treasury Settlements team and other related departments(teams, etc...)

3) Interacted daily with various external and internal personnel, including senior management, to identify trade discrepancies and mitigate potential risk.

4) Developed and implemented automation processes to maximize efficiency while further reducing costs and mitigating potential risks.

5) The last bullet point can probably be removed, albeit a good purpose, it is not particularly relevant to the job and the goal is to ultimately save space. Could maybe be incorporated in a brief summary within your skills and interests.

Boutique Firm:

1) Performed extensive analysis on 90 money management and advisory firms....not sure how the criteria comes into play, I would explain that briefly or just explain who the analysis was performed for and what benefit it brought said person.

2) Developed an internal analysis/report of the firms overall quality and potential needs that was presented to the CEO and CIO. The report resulted in the acquisition of three new clients aggregating $1.5M in managed assets.

3) Could probably exclude or combine elsewhere.

4) Could probably exclude or combine with three. Doesn't add much value and just really states that you combined a bunch of data. If you want to include this, explain what value it added.

5) Collaborated with the Chief Business Development Officer to develop a new client pre-qualification survey which led to 300 new-client leads. (Do you know how many turned into clients?

6) Probably unnecessary or should be combined.

UIG:

This could probably be included in your activities or something, as it is good experience, but was not acquired in a professional setting rather an educational one, at least it appears.

- Hours: As an intern, 40 hours a week. I knew one person who was allowed to clock over that. As a full time analyst, it is pretty much the same, but since it is an hourly full time job some analysts will find ways to clock over 40.

-Company Culture: JPMC, in my opinion, has always had the highest superiority complex of the traditional big 4 banks (Wells, Citi, BoA, JPMC) and its similar internal as well. A lot more suit and tie (even for back office roles) and serious business was my overall impression. People were very friendly and helpful though, anytime i had questions i had multiple resources willing to help. 

-Pay: Interns made 24.50 an hour with a $2000 signing bonus. Full time offer was $26 an hour with I think a $3000 signing bonus. 

-How much you'll learn: A big flaw about the program is you're never sure where your rotations will be, whixh determines how much and what you will learn. Generally most roles are very back office and support related so not a massive amount to learn anyways. 

Overall, the internship will not give you a lot of opportunity for front office roles, but i did have about 3 of my intern colleagues lateral into commercial banking analyst roles and one friend got to interview for investment banking at JPMC, but he didn't get an offer for it.

As has been mentioned, the hiring bar isn't terribly high, or at least wasn't when I did it. As such, the distribution looking back on it was about what you'd expect from most large companies: a couple of stars, a lot of middle to pretty good peeps, and a couple who weren't so great. But I enjoyed the group a lot and I still keep in touch with several of them.

Most of my frustrations from JPMC are hard to reconcile due to being a big corporation, so what I see as negatives are just personal taste. Things like the CTO of your LOB saying your project that has been marketed to you as critical with a hard deadline needs to be put hold on to implement security stuff two weeks before said deadline, then being told to ignore that directive (due to the deadline) a week later. Inflexibility with pay scales. Still needing to support IE8 some three years ago.

eitauisunity,"I think you've misunderstood my position.

All of this is a small stepping stone for the end game. Many people in IRC channels and Reddit, and many other social forums were talking about much bigger and better things than just getting on a legitimate fiat exchange back in 2014.

You have to remember that this technology is born out of a culture of crypto-anarchy and for many early adopters would spell the end of statism.

Part of that is the state breaking bread with the new tech in hopes to regulate and profit off of it, which they will do for a while...until enough people have adopted it and realize that there isn't really shit the state can do.

And the more that happens, the harder the state will clamp down on it. I honestly don't see bitcoin surviving that, as it is already fairly easy to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with enough compute power. But the importance of bitcoin will always be as the first attempt that proved it was possible. There have been better blockchain systems built since bitcoin that have been informed by the weaknesses found in bitcoin under state scrutiny of users of bitcoin. I do see bitcoin surviving as a bridge between ""legitimate"" state crypto and the much larger ""system-d"", global, agorist economy that has developed (and growing rapidly) as a result. That bridge will only be useful as long as there is a state to make that bridge useful.

It will only get harder for the state from that point on.

ohmzar,"Hey at the end of the day the choice is yours, a couple of things to note.

You‚Äôve only been with your current employer 6 months, jumping ship early looks bad on your CV as future employers might think you‚Äôll do so again. Once is okay, just don‚Äôt make a habit of it (In Silicon Valley average tenure is 18 months, I‚Äôd be concerned if I saw someone leaving after 6 months though as that‚Äôs how long a probation period can be)

It sounds like you are joining a startup, that‚Äôs great! Lots of opportunity for growth, lots of money being thrown about, but there is more risk. If funding dries up you are out on the street, and I‚Äôve seen horror stories of people not being paid for months at a startup. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but be aware that it can happen.

Also depending on you motivation/ skill it‚Äôs easier to move in a large company than in small startup, it‚Äôs also less likely you will suddenly lose your job, as they will try and find something for you elsewhere in the company.

The Options you have been offered aren‚Äôt stock in the company, the company isn‚Äôt on the stock market yet because they haven‚Äôt gone public.

An Option is just that: The option to buy stock at an agreed price at a later date.

You stil have to buy the stock, the price is just frozen at the price you are offered them at.

So if you are offered 50,000 options at ¬£1 an option then you will need to cough up ¬£50,000 to get the options, but they may be worth ¬£10 an option at the time, so you‚Äôd make a ‚Äúprofit‚Äù assuming you sell, or you can some in the hope that the company becomes worth more later. 

What is the pension contribution of the new company? I know that today this might not feel like a big deal but early pension contributions are worth more than late ones, I know that some large financial institutions will pay a hefty pension percentage (JPMC will pay 12% if you pay 6) this is free money, you just won‚Äôt see it for 30 years.

What is the bonus structure like at the new company? Is it performance based? Target based? That‚Äôs money you aren‚Äôt gettingif they don‚Äôt have a bonus scheme.

Bear in mind that in moving from 40k to 45k you are crossing a tax threshold, so you won‚Äôt get as much money more than you would going from 35k to 40k.

Having said all this, I am leaving a giant multinational next week to move to a startup. So sometimes it‚Äôs the right decision for you, just take into account all the risk factors.",2018-05-05 16:54:54,dyhe5qs,8,cscareerquestionsEU

Jouissance_juice,"Okay, everyone ITT who is not knee-jerk condemning blockchain is getting downvoted to oblivion. So allow me to walk into the gauntlet.

Blockchain is incredibly subversive. while currencies like BTC and ETH have been allowed to exist, as it is not *illegal* to operate parallel currencies within our economic model, they have been both acquired for control and marginalized by the banking cartel. JPMC, CapOne and BofA come to mind as banks that have restricted purchase of Crypto products on major platforms such as Coinbase. Why?

The reason is, a bitcoin has less in common with a dollar than it does win an actual bank. Eth can even carry out automated transactions and create it's own currency like a bank. If implemented correctly, blockchain technology could be used to subvert the banking cartel. 

Up until this point, Crypto has been sort of a gross capitalistic cash grab. But that doesn't take away it's subversive potential. People are just ignorant as to what it is and how it should work to bypass centralized banking, if for no other reason than it is decentralized.

SirMaximBelov,"I don't know you so can't begin to pontificate on why this is happening to you. It sucks, but I recommend having a sit down with the career center. The trick I found that works really well is practicing storytelling. When they ask you the behavioral questions (""Has XXX BAD THING ever happened to you on the job? How did you handle it?"") Go a little more into detail than you think necessary. Also, look up the questions on Glassdoor before the interview. If you're trying for a sales job, and the company is public, I also recommend looking at their SWOT analysis in the library or finding it online. If you're trying for corporate/finance jobs, go look up the company's 10Q or 10K from last year and take a look at their financials. Ex: If they're quickly gaining capital but not using it, they're probably doing some sort of internal reforms they aren't talking about and are anticipating a loss of money in the short run but gains in the future. Just take a moment to try connecting a few dots. Even if you're super wrong, its impressive as all hell that you knew where to look for information and how to synthesize an answer without knowing all the information.

EstablishmentHack,"&gt; But capital is trivial to shift around. 

Sort of, yes. But I don't see how that effects subsidiaries. They are wealthier than we assume because of that access, but they technically still only hold assets numbering $250 billion and lower in that subsidiary. And to maintain avoiding regulations, they have to keep it lower. 

&gt; The reason for having these regulations is to prevent catastrophe when massive banks are irresponsible with their capital and invest in things like subprime mortgages. Under this bill, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank in the US could still behave as though it were a massive bank like JP Morgan Chase or Leahman Brothers, because it can easily absorb capital from actual Deutsche Bank. But it won't be subject to the same regulations as JPMC or LB. That's.... not good.

Lehman Brothers was a relatively small institution compared to some of the others, at least according to Ben Bernanke. He said breaking up banks into smaller institutions wouldn't change much. And it wasn't just Lehman Brothers melting down alone that caused the 2008 crisis, it was a whole host of things and other firms. 

And it can only absorb capital up to a certain point and only at a certain point in time. It can replenish itself without need to expand its customer base. 

&gt; We could end up with a situation where a few (or more than a few) US-based subsidiaries of massive international banks make irresponsible investments and end up failing. A few of those banks failing would add up to something like Leahman Brothers failing. And we know that banks fail in coordinated ways, because they often make the same investment choices.

It took more than just Lehman Brothers failing to set off the perfect storm that was 2008. That got the ball rolling, but other institutions had to engage in much of the same behavior, and then there was some messing around by insurance companies like AIG too. 

And yes, there is a potential for another crash. There always is. I'd rather we don't change the rules this much. Maybe go up to $150 billion instead of $250 billion. But as it stands, I think the assumption that banks will repeat the same mistakes as last time and melt down the economy again might be overstating the potential problems too much. Technically, Dodd-Frank doesn't make banks and financial institutions immune to collapsing the way they did. 

&gt; Is there any evidence to suggest that they're unduly burdened to the point of harming their business? Everything I've read seems to suggest that they're not being harmed.

They seem to think they're being harmed, hence why they're pushing for this. That's the main reason you've got this many Democratic Senators signing on. Community banks in states are quite powerful when they band together. ",2018-03-09 04:00:55,dve5gdd,1,BlueMidterm2018

Not proud of it but i was already stressed out enough, i just told him to fuck off and get the fuck out of the room.

amopeyzoolion,"&gt; Well, technically the parent bank has more than that value. But if the subsidiaries operate under $250 billion to avoid regulation, then there isn't so much the parent bank will do by means of pumping capital into these banks.

In most IT maintenance projects, contracts are written for a year and renewed at the end of every year. This means that they get H1s for one year increments, which means they need to file a new H1 extension and most possibly a new LCA if the previous one is not valid.

Refusing the PAC refuses money from all those individuals, just because they chose to coordinate in an easily identifiable fashion.

To pick a pharma example, Merck had ~4000 individual contributors to their PAC.   Booker's ban on accepting corporate PAC money would refuse any part of, say, Mr. Darrell Andre Penn's $47.40 contribution to that PAC.  Would he accept money if Mr. Penn contributed directly to him instead of via the PAC?  Did the PAC somehow taint it?  If people on a corporate mailing list or discussion board chatted about politics and some decided as a result that they'd personally contribute to Booker because his opponent was an asshole, would that be evil -- is it only bad if filtered through a PAC instead of informally coordinated over e-mail, Slack and IRC?",2018-02-14 13:11:59,du7ymkr,1,politics
behemoth_cat,"That's cute, considering that Citizens United involved independent expenditures, not campaign contributions (whether from individuals or PACs).

It's not whether it came via a PAC, it's the motives of the individuals who fund it.  Shouldn't really make a difference whether Mr. Dimon (to take one example at random, I have no idea of his opinions re: Sen. Booker; for all I know, they're mortal enemies for some reason) contributes directly to his campaign as an individual or contributes to a JP Morgan Chase-organized PAC and coordinates with other JPMC employees to direct that money to his campaign.  One can look up the individual contributors of a PAC (FEC claims 7000 for the previous calendar year), and nothing prevents them from reaching out to a candidate in phone calls or personal meetings, either.

CU doesn't enter into it unless JPMC (or Mr. Dimon personally) chose to make politically-tinged expenditures without coordinating with any candidate's campaign.

Cardinal is very on the median as far as pay goes. Their tech stuff (at least when I was there) was run by business execs, so it was not very fun to work. Someone might have more extensive experience, I was there only a short time.

JPMC is just absolutely massive. The pay seems good for the work and JPMC seems like it is always TRYING to innovate and move forward, for better or worse. Benefits are pretty good IMO and my coworkers are pretty alright.

OSU is where I worked the longest. If you don't work for OCIO or one of the more outside partner agencies (OSC, OARnet etc.) you'll probably be very underpaid for your level of experience. Interviews can be brutal, and the hiring process is very slow. I enjoyed my time there, and the environment is very laid back generally.",2018-02-05 22:34:43,dtrqolq,5,Columbus
SoftWear_Requirement,"All of the below is coming from a technology background, but here is my assessment:

With most of the big guys (JPMC, Huntington, nationwide, cardinal health, OSU, etc) is that pay and culture can vary depending on what business unit you work in. 

Huntington has median pay for the market, but is incredibly invested in the community and has a very ‚ÄúColumbus‚Äù culture at the corporate level

Nationwide has a good reputation as an employer and pays well. From what I‚Äôve known, their culture can be bogged down by ‚Äúparalysis by analysis‚Äù at the corporate level. 

JPMC pays the best (in my experience), but you are expendable. This is a great place to sponge up how the ‚Äúpros‚Äù operate to take away and make a difference at a smaller institution.

Often overlooked is cardinal health, they are a GIANT company with many great opportunities for development. Personally, their location and commute time would be a big benefit.

OSU has many corporate jobs, but generally pays well under the market value, and from what I‚Äôve seen, lacks senior leadership and transparency. Great retirement and benefits though...

Or, if you‚Äôre looking to make your mark at a smaller place, check out the idea foundry - https://ideafoundry.com/ . I‚Äôve been here a few times and the leadership is very inspirational.

tarantula13,"I don't get exactly what you are trying to prove. Of course college grads are going to earn less coming out of an enormous recession? The subprime mortgage crisis was an enormous failing that was rife with with fraud and tilted motivations. It was a failing of private companies concealing fraud and making absolutely piss-poor decisions and it was a failing of the government for not properly regulating it even when they had the chance (see Brooksley Born). There were a lot of entities at fault from mortgage lenders, investment banks, the federal government, insurance companies, etc. Despite that massive failing we've come out of it and the economy is better than ever now. Also I don't get what you mean by millennials expectations out of their 401ks?

A lot of your post is centered around public education. Is your argument against the way the US government runs or capitalism? Or is it a combination of both and how they work together? I largely agree with you at how ridiculous tuition prices have become. Having student loan debt be non-dischargeable and having any student that wants it get a federal loan has skyrocketed tuition prices. Demand has also skyrocketed with more people than ever going to college and a higher percentage of young people going to college than ever before. These seem like failings of the federal government to me, maybe you could shift some blame on to the private sector for creating this demand? I don't see how that is indicative of capitalism unless you're combining the US government and the private sector under the collective label of capitalism.

I looked at your Intuit article from CNN Money (you need to fix the link btw) and it says that roughly 20 million are estimated to be a part of the gig economy that aren't by choice while many others report they do so by choice because they're happier. This is indeed very troubling, but it's a far cry from the 33% and more like 12.5%. What you are talking about amounts to underemployment, a rate which has been falling since the recession. Gallup has been measuring it since 2010: 
http://news.gallup.com/poll/127538/workforce-weekly.aspx

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been measuring underemployment since 1994 (U-6):

http://www.macrotrends.net/1377/u6-unemployment-rate

These rates have hit neared or already hit pre-recession levels and have been falling every year. I don't see it as a problem getting worse. I tend to trust Gallop more than the government statistics (they tend to under report the issue) when it comes to employment and their 12.6% seems to fall in line with what McKinsey estimated in your article.

The housing market seems like a separate issue that is adversely affecting millennials. The problem being that all the good jobs are located in cities, but there is not enough room for everyone to have home ownership near the cities. Also add in the fact that many people are viewing housing as an investment and the foreign investing into local housing markets have skyrocketed prices to unaffordable levels. Housing hasn't really changed much outside of cities and are still affordable, but the large millennial preference seems to be living in or near major cities.

Apple isn't the most successful company ever lol. Innovation is built from the work of others, including the government and other private companies. The personal computer is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century, but that wouldn't have been possible without the earlier groundwork by IBM and government agencies before it. I don't see how that takes away from their innovation. IBM had all the tools to invent the personal computer but chose not to. Hell the transistor was an invention funded privately and we would be nowhere today without it. Bell Labs has also developed programming languages such as C and C++, the UNIX operating system, and [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs). Much of our modern technological age comes from contributions both from the private and public sector. We're a collaborative society after all. I could go on and on about private sector innovation, but that's a waste of time. Just look at some of the biggest innovations of the 20th century. A majority are from the private sector, almost all are built upon the backs of some other technology whether it be public or private.

When it comes to JPMC, I'm not trying to argue what they did or if it was wrong or not. Fraud obviously is wrong and our political climate allows for this abuse to happen. My stance is that it's a blip on the map when you compare it to capitalism as a whole. It's one individual case that has far reaching effects, but it's still small compared to capitalism as a whole. You're always going to have bad actors, it's up the government to de-incentivize it and punish that behavior. Same thing with Uber and AirBnB. Their entire business model was allowing people to use other people's services on a small scale. People like Uber [because they think they're better than taxis and most prefer them not be subject to those regulations](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/05/19/on-demand-ride-hailing-apps/). Same could be said about AirBnB. I don't know what else you would describe their shortcomings as other than growing pains. You want us to go back to only using expensive hotels and taxis? How is that helping? These companies exist because people want them to exist, it's pretty plain and simple.

There are certain factors about this generation which are less desirable than previous generations, namely the tuition and housing prices as you touched on. I tend to believe what I said about peace and prosperity because the world keeps getting better:

1. [Globally, people living in poverty has fallen tremendously since the industrial revolution](https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Poverty-Since-1820.png)

2. [Food prices have fallen dramatically over time](https://ourworldindata.org/food-prices)

3. [Disease is being treated and eradicated more over time](https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases)

4. [Charitable giving has risen over time](https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/)

5. [Crime has fallen substantially over time](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/30/5-facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/)

These are just a handful of examples, the world is becoming a more prosperous place and most of the worlds successful nations are market economies. I know one doesn't necessarily imply the other, but I don't understand how capitalism is failing. Public opinion among millennials is one thing, but cherry picking small parts doesn't override the vast gains we've made as a civilization.

aqouta,"This is coming across as just a plain old blind grudge that this sub has.

If you don't like bitcoin that's fine, it has a lot of problems but you'd be foolish to actually try and claim that the blockchain has no use.

&gt; For one thing, there‚Äôs already a costless, instant way to exchange value without a middleman: cash. Bitcoins substitute for dollars, but Visa and MasterCard actually sit on top of dollar-based banking transactions, providing a set of value-added services like enabling banks to track fraud disputes, and verifying the identity of the buyer and seller. It turns out that for the person paying for a product, the key feature of a new payment system‚Ää

This is not a free service and subject to abuses. An option to send money in a different way with different pros and cons does not make a different way useless.

&gt;Plus, it‚Äôs not actually that good a payment system‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäVisa can handle sixty thousand transactions per second, while Bitcoin historically taps out at seven.

If this was meant to be a criticism of bitcoin then fair but if you're targeting blockchain then this is just ignorant. Ripple can match Visa, Raiblocks and IOTA can outstrip it. 

&gt; If you brought Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction volume up to Visa‚Äôs it would be using as much electricity as the rest of the world put together.

This displays a fundamental ignorance of how and why electricity is consumed in proof of work blockchain transactions that's frankly staggering. This is just wrong, that is not how this works at all and this claim should basically disqualify anything else this author writes about block chain.

&gt;The government-backed banking system provides FDIC guarantees, ... have a nice day.‚Äù

This is irrelevant to the blockchain and easily solvable with modern or even basic security.

&gt;This issue is particularly near and  ... up with something very different from blockchain!

If the author actually bothered to familiarize themselves with the underlying technology they would learn that they can actually build tech that manages these keys for their clients in a way that prevents these attacks. This is akin to criticizing paper money because it's not heavy enough to make it cumbersome for thieves to carry away in the days of modern banking.

The rest of the anti-privacy rant isn't even critical of blockchain and ignores that fact that blockchains such as bitcoin are actually easier to track as the entire ledger is public.

&gt;In terms of interbank payments, ... publish them, and make them irreversible.

Ripple is continuing to see increased adoption and isn't the only are banks are adopting blockchain technology. JPMC is working on a Ethereum fork called Quorum and many banks are looking into the tech. The adoption is slow because banks are traditionally slow to adopt new technology for many reasons including regulatory concerns, risk aversion and just sheer bureaucracy. The idea that it taking more than 3 years for a bank to adopt radically new technology is some kind of sign that banks will never adopt that technology is madness, I recently had a project at a bank just starting to use decade old technology for the first time. Banks are just now, as in within the last year starting to adopt the public cloud.

&gt;Criticisms of DAO rollout on Ethereum

This is like calling the internet unworkable because a cable went bad and crashed the first network. Was it a big problem? yes. Does that mean smart contracts are fundamentally unworkable? of course not.

This whole section seems to fundamentally miss the promise of distributed apps and smart contracts. They aren't meant to replace all lawyers or even very many of them, They're to enable entirely new things that were too cumbersome before, I don't need a third party if I want to place a wager on a baseball game, the smart contract escrows my gamble with that of any number of parties that want to participate and handles all the distribution; there is no way to do this as securely and easily without some kind of trustless arbiter. 

&gt;Distributed storage, computing, and messaging...

The main purpose of blockchain in storage is to make documents tamper proof. You store some amount of a hash of a document that cannot be amended due to the properties of blockchains and you are then able to prove that the document has never been tampered with. 

&gt;Stock issuance

This section is ignorant of why an exchange like NASDAQ would be interested in reducing the risk of ownership mixups. And then criticizes ICOs for being unregulated or less regulated when that is their purpose and not at all a fundamental criticism of blockchain, one could easily design an ICO process that is properly regulated and greatly improves the IPO process. 

&gt;Without diving too thoroughly into the details of each of these, it seems the use cases all fall apart pretty quickly. For voting, the status quo is recording the total number of ballots cast, with the voter dropping a visible paper ballot in a box, and journalists and observers from both sides watching the ballot boxes the whole time. The tough problem in voting is keeping who voted for who anonymous and yet making sure that voters and votes are one to one. Paper does this so much better than blockchain.

This is such a ridiculous it's hard to even start with it. It's like saying manned flight is useless because walking is better at getting you to your mailbox.  Or saying email would never take off because it was impractical to connect to points with copper cables when the postal service exists and does just fine.

&gt;For a public notary or similar ... provides this service?

Neither irrefutable prove anything, documents on servers can be doctored and modified. 

If you don't like bitcoin then good, it's bad tech. If you don't think blockchain is going to be the future of currency that's a defensible position. But actually claiming blockchain has no place in the future because 9 years after the theory was first publish it isn't used everywhere is just willful blindness to the real world adoption taking place. Be very careful in letting your dislike of bitcoin make you Luddites.

 **Content**:  

 &gt;**Intro&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;It is surely satisfying to many of you on this sub when Jamie Dimon (JPMC CEO) or Ray Dalio (Bridgewater head, largest hedge fund in the world) speak negatively about crypto only for the assets to continue appreciating at a manic pace. I appreciate that. 

&gt;There is, however, a clear misunderstanding and paranoia among all non professional (do not take that as pejorative) investor communities about what Wall Street's plan and role in creating a professional market for crypto. This post will walk through HOW infrastructure to trade on established markets is created, WHAT safeguards are required to manage risk, and WHY certain industry groups are protesting last minute. 

&gt;**HOW - creating the infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;Orderly markets need 3 characteristics to function. 

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;Centralized clearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;Market makers who agree to be ""members"" of the clearing house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&gt;Collateral and backstop &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centralized clearing&lt;/em&gt; basically means all trades are executed not between direct buyers and sellers, but between the central ""counterparty"" and all participants.  This eliminates enormous amounts of operational risk (the machine fails to work) default risk (buyer fails to pay seller or seller fails to deliver) and settlement risk (pipes are jammed and buyers/sellers can't complete the transaction). BTC suffers from all 3 of these risks in big ways today - there are top ranked posts right now about hacks, fraud, and general fuck ups. 

&gt;&lt;em&gt;Market makers&lt;/em&gt; place margin and backstop into the system in exchange for the role of becoming a clearing broker. MMs are usually mischaracterized as free loaders, but in fact take most of the downside with limited but stable upside. This is because the MM actually bears most of the credit risk on its brokered trades. If BTC crashes through resistance to a low, the over extended bulls get wiped out; if it explodes to a new high, a wave of shorts can go massively negative. Both positions &lt;em&gt;will exist&lt;/em&gt; in a futures market. MMs contractually have to step in and cover the pipeline, meaning actual traders get their money or BTC and can move on. This brings us to...

&gt;**WHAT - collateral and safeguards&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;So Big Bad Banks have to put up real money (sometimes 20% of daily net volume) just to live off the bid/ask spread. That value at risk gives the market makers natural incentive to keep the market orderly. In addition, a backstop will be put in place. 

&gt;For perspective, DTCC (the biggest and baddest central clearing house) has a &lt;em&gt;$14+ billion&lt;/em&gt; credit facility that can be drawn same day to close out trades. Who funds this line of credit? All the market makers/banks. There's serious regulatory capital cost to keep &lt;em&gt;$600-900 million&lt;/em&gt; of unfunded credit open on your balance sheet. I know this because I worked on a specialized loan desk for years at a major bank. DTCC couldn't require a bank's participation in the credit line, but interestingly your willingness to participate and your required overall collateral charge (the Real Money I asked to earlier) were inversely correlated. Which leads to....

&gt;**WHY - WHY Wall Street is reasonably uncomfortable with playing a traditional role in a new market&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;We've discussed the major reasons why an established market makes sense, who bears the risks, and the costs associated with being a market maker. 

&gt;Even the very bullish BTC community understands that assets don't just go up. Volatility is a fact of life for any traded product. Therefore it's rational for the institutions bearing risk on your derivatives trades to say ""hold on, let's not just speed this through the approval process like Equity Futures Product #924"" &lt;em&gt;because BTC derivatives are a cash bet on an unprecedented and largely speculative first-of-its-kind digital asset&lt;/em&gt;. 

&gt;**Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;

&gt;So let's be clear - this is not a conspiracy. This is bridge building, and the people insuring the bridge want to make sure is being built correctly before the first cars start driving over it. I'm all for BTC, but my time on Wall Street has given me insight into the planning process I wanted to share with the community.

there are other directors too, he's not the sole director so hes not the only one overseeing JPMC. He can also be a sleeping director if he so wishes. so in your definition of director, its just doing admin/management stuff and not doing doctor-y work? 

You should know that if you're a director in any company you do what u specialise in or if you're too old but experienced u oversee the company. in this case he is the medical director so he does still do doctor's stuff and mayb do some basic management like assigning doctor/ health equipments. 

it doesnt mean he just stops doing doctor-y stuff and just oversees a place lmao. 

example some restaurants have their chefs as their shareholder/director so that the chefs wont run off to another restaurant's offer and theyll put in more effort knowing the profit goes into their pocket too. so in your definition the chef just oversees and doesnt cook because he is the director/shareholder?

another example clinics. some of the directors are doctors right? do u see them stop doing doctor-y work and just 'oversees' the place? 

also dr zul is a director in his clinic Vitaliv and he is a good doctor. do u see him stop doing doctor-y stuff and just oversees the place before he became a minister?

grimview,"How would you word it better? The abstract was focused on proof of the bubble. I said ""IT resources"" (training/ certification/ indoctrination) is the bubble not ""IT tech"" (software), though I have suspicions that AI is also a bubble. Its not that there are no opportunities, just that the job numbers may be exaggerated &amp; misleading (like inflating STEM jobs by combining with Sales). Part of the problem is figuring out how to explain with sounding like tangent, because most of the puzzle pieces (ERG, Cartels, Title 7) people are unaware of or misunderstand. My theory is bubbles can result from groupthink, MLM &amp; cartel tactics that violate laws (anti-trust, anti-compete, title 7, conflict of interest). 


Since you noted ""equal pay,"" consider the similarity to the ""anti-competitive practice of a tribute payout to a minority group"" (identity cartel). Then compare certification/education (paid training) to how an MLM (Multi level Marketing) works, where the recruitment &amp; training are the main source of revenue. Most people focus on defending the MLM message because they don't realize they are invested in an MLM. Cartels are compared to ""Employee Resource Groups (ERG)"" because both create artificial shortages to rationalize training in a segregated identity territory (like RAD learner, black girls code), control the number of entrants (quotas) &amp; control labor pricing (equal pay). However, as seen at JPMC, an ERG can 'grow your career' by switching STEM women to a different field, like training, marketing, sales (traditional women's careers) to ensure the shortage does not end. You make an interesting point about ""dev ops"" &amp; ""marketing"" pay differences as often people that switch jobs within a company, retain their old salary, which could result in pay differences for the same job. The training can result in a bubble of resources as others (not part of the cartel) jump on the groupthink bandwagon to train &amp; recruit. For example Salesforce is the top of the MLM pyramid, then user groups that are fronts for training schools (like RAD learner / women in tech /girl develop it), resulting in flood of IT resources that due to lack of jobs become  trainers, marketer, sales or unpaid consult re-sellers. JPMC had segregated job fairs to target identity groups to increase membership in its identity Employee Resource Group (Cartels), but ""Title 7 specifically forbids job advertisements based on race, sex and other protected traits."" When an employee use company resources to promote a political ideology, it can create a conflict of interest. In groupthink expertise is removed as training does not equal experience, &amp; motivation is preferred over skill. The final piece is that the Employ resource Groups share tactics through their activist groups to result in the many corporations with the same Culture (political ideological belief) to result in bubble bursting at multiple corporations. Could this be the formula to create a bubble? Why or why not?


Ultimately a few people at the top of the MLM Cartel (identity politic klans) make a lot of money by pretending to help their own kind thru training, but the people at the bottom will blame the corporations &amp; oppression, instead of their friends pressuring them to hop on an MLM band wagon.

In short, it is a coordinated attack on Bitcoin by Dimon (demon) and JPM to regulate cryptocurrency in general or create a stranglehold on the blockchain rollout across all facets of investment and commercial banking. And, in the meantime, JPM can process Bitcoin payments for clients, charge a fee to do so, no matter how much the currency rises or falls. 

Now think of how many subsidiary companies JPMC has listed. Per the below link, JPMC has 39 listed subsidiaries with the SEC. Imagine how many shadow banking entities, or waaay offshore holding companies they have. To me, Dimon can say one thing, but him and his bank are still betting on it on countless levels, many of which are not even known at this time by the laymen.

Not true. JPMC was one of the strongest banks out of the crisis, they even had the liquidity to buy Lehman.

Yeap, just like the loan they gave me tied to the libor, that went up 10x in 10 months when all I wanted was a fixed short term construction loan. I paid back my loan in full while these clowns made more in fees on my project than I did. Many of my associates had their projects seized by Dimon and his cronies, sold off to his friends at discounted rates, and gets  money from taxpayers to cover his losses on loan. What about the small developer who is left a devastating debt or pension fund that lost 40% and caused so many to put off retirement? Bitcoin gives people a true choice. Trust in your peers and eliminate the leaches that live off  the masses.  They have created a system where everything we do, from buying a cup of coffee to paying our mortgages these few  people live off the fees.

From the get go, I knew I would take C1 over JPMC for the following reasons:

1. I felt more valued at C1 than JPMC (i.e. C1 offers to fly out anyone who received an offer to spend a few days in one of their offices). C1 seemed like they actually wanted me vs. JPMC. For instance, I've been getting regular emails from my C1 recruiter and randomly enlisted employees asking if I had any questions or concerns. Meanwhile JPMC gave me a verbal offer, sent me the written offer a week later, and has been completely silent since then. 
2. The pay was significantly better ($19k + housing at C1 vs. $14.7k + overtime [if any] + $1500 bonus at JPMC). Last summer, I paid ~$42/night for an apartment in Chicago. From what I can tell, housing prices in DC and Chicago are comparable. So, housing comes out to be just shy of $3k for both offers (both internships are 10 weeks long). So the total value of the C1 offer is $22k ($19k salary + $3k housing) while as the JPMC offer is $16.2k ($14.7k salary + $1.5k bonus; assuming 0 overtime). In other words, C1 pays 36% more than JPMC.
3. Full time positions at C1 pay significantly more than JPMC. 
4. The interviewers/recruiters/workers I talked to at C1 seemed actually happy. Meanwhile the two interviewers I had from JPMC both looked like they hated their lives. ",2017-11-02 06:10:48,dp7lsht,22,cscareerquestions

There is a bit of a boost in spring, but it is overshadowed by a shard decline in spending in fall.

StablePippenRedux,"You're missing what I'm saying. There are a lot of people like me who would make a life in Canada if the options existed; but, they don't. If you're educated in, say, marketing and want more than a brand management or RMA position, such as a creative or strategy role, they don't exist in Canada. You very literally have to leave and go to London or the U.S. Canadian companies, more and more, are branches of larger US outfits, so all of the creative, the strategic and the directional are crafted out of the U.S., so any field that falls under those buckets aren't recruited for in Canada and you can't get hired in Canada. 

What I'm saying is that Canadians are perfectly content to wag their finger at the Americans but creating insufficient opportunities for the people they're educating. 3 years as a developer for Amazon in Austin, and you can go to any company in the world. Fulfill a contract in a post-MBA boot camp at JPMC or GE, and again, you can go anywhere in the world. But those options aren't available in Canada. 

Walmart Canada's post-MBA program is called ""DARE"" and really is a wonderful program to learn to steward the status quo; but, the US program is a strategy and development role that pushes graduates to shake the status quo. It's the same across the spectrum: Canada's business market is lean, sales-focused with no real vertical movement. Canadians job hop more than any other nationality and it's almost all lateral moves. 

Would I have stayed if I could have? Sure, but the ""meh"" role I got hired for out of my MBA almost immediately got sent down to the U.S., and I could have stayed, hoping and praying something came up, or cross and never look back.

They say it's funny that Dimon speaks so poorly of bitcoin yet JPMC partnered with ZCash to develop their own block chain technology and has dozens of block chain dev open requisitions. Bitcoins value stems from the block chain tech, if it is fraud then why are you trying to develop something similar?

Anyone who can think critically knows he doesn't truly believe what he says, there is an agenda behind it, other wise why else would he say anything? 

Scare customers into staying with USD and not diversifying? 

Then again this is the same guy that 2 years ago said Bitcoin would fail because no country would accept it. 

He's the CEO of a Fortune 25 so his words hold a lot of weight. By saying something like bitcoin is 'fraud', it personally makes me think Chase must be ready to roll out their own block chain product, they are apart of the Ethereum Alliance after all.

There are some soft boundaries in that spending more than you have means you need access to credit, which diminishes the further from your ability to effectively repay. But those probably don't matter much when we're talking about ""only"" thousands of dollars, since that amount of credit is very easy to obtain for most Americans.

There's also the fact that for some, spending money is an act of gaining status. IE, people who spend a lot of money in game, get status in game and feel good about that. This may be completely divorced from income level, since in today's society status is accumulated in other ways^2. That leaves a lot of the conspicuous spending status markers to those with middle or lower income, counter-intuitively.

Here's a fun fact: Go back roughly 5-6 years when all of this was happening, and 4/5 of the top mortgage lenders in the country, representing **a more than 50% share of the total national market**, have settled lawsuits (or are currently being sued) because they racially discriminated against, collectively, at least ~400,000 black families.



https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/the-mortgage-market-is-now-dominated-by-nonbank-lenders/2017/02/22/9c6bf5fc-d1f5-11e6-a783-cd3fa950f2fd_story.html?utm_term=.40c3e77d3def

Question- when you see a drug dealer arrested, do you think ""great! That's solves the drug problem in this neighborhood!""? Or do you think ""great. There's probably 10 more who haven't been caught.""? What about when 5 drug dealers are arrested? What are the odds nearly **every bank was doing this**, given how many have been clearly caught and their lawyers and actuaries told them to settle for massive amounts because they knew they would *lose*?



There are about 14.7M black households in the US. Probably a fair guess that the vast majority of those who are getting home loans are in the middle class - the poor can't afford them, and there are far fewer rich, and many of the rich don't need them. 38.4% of black families are ""middle class"", or about 5.5M black familes. Of those, **nearly 400K were a part of racial discrimination settlements,** with another wave of lawsuits still in process. You've already got around 7% of black middle class families that have been impacted by explicit racial discrimination for their mortgage. Who wants to bet it grows to 15-20% by the time all is said and done?

You know what's really funny? 4.5% of whites lost their homes to foreclosure. But **8% of blacks did.** I wonder what the overlap is of blacks in those class action lawsuits, and blacks who lost home's? Hmmm, **CURIOUS.**

http://www.responsiblelending.org/mortgage-lending/research-analysis/foreclosures-by-race-and-ethnicity.pdf

Huh, it's almost like **explicitly racist predatory lending practices meant blacks were disproportionally fucked by foreclosures.** 



And easily the same numbers were discriminated against by auto lenders. And I haven't even dug into personal loans, payday loans, etc. etc. Want to guess whether those exhibited the same bias?



But yeah, ""baseless talking points."" Uh huh.

---------

Oh, and your point about:



&gt;You cant give people out of poverty.¬† You have to fundamentally change the way they think.¬† You have to teach them the value of work.¬† Todays black culture values what people like you tell them to.¬† Handouts and reperations.¬†



Yeah that's wrong. Roughly 2/3 of the poor have jobs. They don't need to be taught anything. They're already working.



http://www.epi.org/publication/poor-people-work-a-majority-of-poor-people-who-can-work-do/



And when you ""give them out of poverty"", suddenly 1000 other things change for the better. Like this guy, who paid for free child care and free college (for anyone who qualified) in one particularly drug and crime ridden, poor, predominantly black neighborhood. High school graduation rates jumped from 25% to 100%, and crime virtually disappeared.



https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/us/tangelo-park-orlando-florida.html



And when the poor are given handouts, they **don't spend them on booze and drugs, even when it's cash.**



https://givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers



Again- you've been fed a line of fluffy, airy, theoretical bullshit. Not unlike communism. Turns out- libertarian ""bootstraps"" mentality is just as fucked and out of touch with reality as communism. **People don't want to sit around doing nothing.** You ever been out of work? The boredom will drive you **crazy.**



It's not **blacks** that have a problem working. It's the mentally ill/ / hopelessly addicted/ homeless. Which is *not the same population.* Your right wing ideologues intentionally confuse the two. They're wrong. The data doesn't support their dumbass pie in the sky theory. They are as hopeless as fucking hippies chanting peace love dope. Their ideology is **stupid** because it **doesnt work.**

----------

So remember:



*Blacks are still getting more consistently financially fucked in the US than other races. Based solely on race.



*2/3 of the chronically poor are Already Working and don't need any incentive to continue working.



*Handouts to the poor Do Work- they make them less poor, and no, they don't spend those handouts on booze or drugs.



Can you see the light yet? The lies you have been fed? The nonsense ideology that borders on religion- with its complete absence of fact, and it's theories that fall apart every time any actual fact or evidence or research is applied?",2017-08-24 22:15:01,dm2a3d9,1,UpliftingNews

1. IOTA - internet of things (iot) will be very big in next 5 years...if iota can actually capture even 10% of iot business (as currency to exchange services in iot) it will do wonders. It's actually solving problems with its recent partnership.

2. NEO - etherium of China. . No special language to be learned by coders... (this is similar to lisk , eon and stratis ..but here comes the best part) it's actually partly supported by Chinese government... now china has its own Google ..n check out alexa for the traffic there...so m pretty sure china's own etherium too will do wonders.

3. XRP ripple - I know ppl will hate me to support a centralised coin...but as I said I am an investor not a user.. n I bet if bank of UK , Japan and rumour has it even FED are putting there resources and interest in it .. I would too. It's actually one coin that has a daily practical usage in real life.

4. Siacoin - I recently learned about it and while it's far from achieving what it wants...it's goal is worthy of our investment. . Also I compared it's cost with the cost of current cloud storage ..it's 80% cheaper. 

5. Golem - similar to my openion on siacoin..it's love what it wants to do..so worth a minor investment.

6. Monero - again a coin that is actually being used daily and solves a community purpose.. it can even be used in porn industry apart frm dark web ...which is legal and huuuuge ..dnt knw if monero proponent have thought about it.

7. Stratis - sleeping giant..I yet have to investigate more about it... I knw it's similar to etherium and neo....but I also knw it's in partnership with Microsoft. . I minor push or even a mention of it by Bill gates can send it soaring (and this is even if it can do shit...which I knw is not the case..I think in future big companies will simply adopt successful coins and blockchains rather than making there won ones. Just like JPMC is using ether ) 

8. BTC ..yes it's slow ..yes there are coins coming to overcome all its shortcoming ...but it's mother of all coins...it will always remain as  coin to keep value even if it doesn't have practical use of future. 
Biggest plus is it will have demand coz its a currency to trade in any curency unless ether or some other takes its place...biggest practicle example.. any one in Asia , Africa nd many more places can only buy BTC ..they then transfer it to exchanges like polo Nd bitfinex and trade in altcoins and then again convert to BTC to cash in Fiat.

Here is my 2 cents .. I yet have to study many many coins.. but Btc , iota and neo  are my best bet and constitute my major portfolio ..more I learn about them more I am convinced about there future.",2017-08-14 03:33:37,dlkls56,18,Bitcoin

Having said that, my experience in JP Morgan Chase in Bengaluru was not that great. I joined right after my Bachelor's. My first manager was great, helping me understand the culture, and getting used to being in a team ...
But many of my friends, and later me, got managers who were TCS/Infosys employees, and consultants for JPMC. They have a different attitude towards juniors, and didn't care much apart from getting good ratings for themselves, and projecting themselves as good managers to upper management. My manager used to make sure to close all the tickets, even though he never worked on them. And hence his name appeared on each ticket, making it look like he has worked on all of them, which is what the upper management looks at.

From there they will give you an appointment which is maybe 1-2 months later. Than you will see the doctor who will give you the scan approval and than you will wait for your results. So maybe a 3 month wait till you get your results. The main issue is that the clinic may not give you an approval, or because of your young age the specialist will not take your case seriously or you may not list enough symptoms for them to take your case.

If you think it's urgent enough or serious enough, just try to do the scan overseas. You can get your result faster and it will put your mind at ease knowing the result.

rostbrot,"max out your loan options in this order, Federal Subsidized &gt; Federal Un-subsidized &gt; then resort to private (with a family member with good credit co-signing if they're ok with that)

Fixed rate IHMO is more desirable in this economy...  The others tie to the prime rate which has started to go up in the past couple years, so unless the economy takes a hit again, the prime rate will probably keep inching up?  It's still relatively low that locking in a fixed rate may be more beneficial than the risk of a floating rate.  It sucks when you're in school though, the reality is that people just take what they can get so they can get through school....  Here are links where you can see the history of the prime rate https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/historical-prime-rate.htm and a short forecast https://www.forecasts.org/prime.htm

Don't be scared of the federal loans though.  They're the best you can get and come with a lot of protections once you graduate.  It sucks that they'll be a burden after graduation but they have some built in safety measures that ease the pain.  Avoid the private ones as much as possible but use them if you have to.

Banks are excited about speeding up payments and lowering the need to rely on intermediaries, the block chain has many use cases and public block chains don't really compete with banks.

You also have to note banks like citi, boa and JPMC have thousands and thousands of developers and despite being swamped with necessary beaurocracy are perfectly able to keep up with technological evolution, not as close to the cutting edge as fintechs but not so far behind as people tend to think.

Second, go to google maps and look up JPMC 1 manhattan plaza. that is the last building in the video that the plane flies parallel to. Its to the left of the skinny pointy building. On google maps the approx walking distance between that and same distance to the south tower is around 150m. Remember that the footprints of the WTC memorial are a little smaller than the actual buildings. It takes the plane about 1 second to get from that point to the tower. If you do the conversion from mps to mph thats around 540mph. Now that number is a little high, but this isnt fucking exact by any stretch. Just goes to show you that you can get very close to the official number just by looking at shitty video. Now go fuck yourself.

dougie_g,"Many regulations are well intentioned but don't actually work properly when applied to business. There's an enormous amount of back and forth between regulators and financial institutions required to work out what they mean in X scenario. 

I'll give you an example. Say a regulation requires banks to disclose all of the charges they levy on their clients. Seems reasonable right? The problem is that it doesn't work like that in practice. An asset manager calls a broker and say 'I'd like a million Amazon shares please'. Say they're trading at $20, the broker will go find them on the market and charge the manager $20.01 for them. That's why you don't get the same price buying and selling. But is that 1 cent a charge fee? You haven't just tacked it on - it's your markup. It's like going into a shop and demanding that a shopkeeper tells you how much he bought each item for. 

So then you go and ask the SEC what that rule means, and they tell you to disclose that 1 cent per share. Ok. But then you get the same scenario every single day, where the rules don't quite match up with the business. 

It's an ongoing process to figure out, and often this ongoing effort to find a workable route is characterised as evil banks influencing regulators. Same when they give input into the rules - usually they are arguing for more sensible and workable solutions but it's often seen - fairly, given most people don't understand what's being discussed - as unfair, shadowy, and corrupt. 

I'd encourage anyone to read Consultation Papers and such to see how the sausage is made. I'm English and FCA CPs and Policy Statements are available online. All the industry responses are published along with the response by the regulator. Sometimes they agree, sometimes they don't. 

The key - and this is where both sides (left and right) are usually wrong - isn't to have *more* or *less* regulation. It's to have good regulation that achieves the objectives it aims for while allowing business to continue. Safer markets and investor protection - no one can argue against these things. It's about how to achieve them rather than whether to do so. I'd point out here that JPMC tends to be quite good at taking its regulatory obligations seriously, at the very least since 2008. Dimon talks about it a lot. 

I often think people get stuck into the argument without understanding it at all. People go mad about how nothing changed after 2008 but that couldn't be further from the truth. They argue for bringing back Glass Steagall but don't know what Dodd Frank or the Volcker Rule actually do - did you know that Dodd Frank vastly overhauled the capital requirement system for example? And how? 

As for corporate tax breaks, I'm not a big proponent in general but they have to be looked at pragmatically. 

I'd consider myself left wing by the way and would have agreed with you until I became a lawyer and did this stuff for real. You quickly realise that the shades of grey in this area are vast. It's not sufficient to say 'bring back Glass Steagall' and leave it there. Sadly though, the economy and the rules are so complex (by necessity I would add) that it's almost impossible to have a real public debate about this stuff without everyone just bringing their own preconceived views to the table.",2017-07-18 01:08:09,dkc9946,2,TrueReddit

97% of the Stern MBA class of 2018 has prior work experience. And the average amount of work experience is just under 5 years.

Also, what is your ""company"" if you're coming straight out of undergrad?

Edit: also according to you're posts you currently work for JPMC so you didn't clearly go into an MBA straight from undergrad. Also, having two upvotes on a post that's been dead for a few days is a clear sign that you upvoted your own post. Have fun in your fake MBA program with your fake friends at Stern.

Final note, MBA programs tend to want people with work experience because they're about networking, not learning stuff. MBA's teach you pretty much nothing you couldn't learn on your own since finance requires half a working brain.

BeachJustic3,"I love his whole ""it will crash, hard, it's inevitable"" bit. 

1) It's not like bitcoin is immune to crashes, remember when the ETF got rejected? Pepperidge farm remembers. But, and the same thing would happen with Ethereum, belief in the underlying tech will drive it back up. 

2) a network split wont cause a large, sustained, crashed. We've already been through a hard fork situation, and we recovered. This whole mantra bitcoiners have that hard forks are bad is just idiotic. The tech has to evolve. Creating a blockchain and not introducing updates and implementing better standards is bad for the ecosystem. It's why Bitcoin is arguably unsustainable right now. Using his logic the only option is to create a new blockchain, with a new name, and move away because any sort of hard fork or network split is inherently bad. It's so stupid and illogical it's literally painful to read every time I see someone argue against evolving bitcoin or eth as a platform. If people want to continue with the old platform, and all it's weaknesses, let them. That's the chaotic beauty of open source development and blockchains. Just because the main developers wants to move in a different direction doesn't mean you can't take the reigns as the custodian of the old way. Do whatever you want, and let the market dictate what it prefers. Eth vs Etc has shown the market prefers sticking with the latest version. 

3) Big ICO startup that fails/fucks up, sure this will happen. But a separate entity launching crowdfunding on Ethereum that fails speaks more to the startup than Ethereum. Ethereum enables ICOs to occur, but the success of said ICO is not a reflection on the capability or future of the Ethereum network as a whole. That's a false equivalence. 

4) Not having a decent ICO for a couple of weeks making sell pressure? Really? Because all Ethereum powers is ICOs? There's absolutely no investment on speculation of Ethereum's uses at various government levels, PoS implementation, or Raiden apparently. I guess we're just the kickstarter of blockchain now, all we're good for is ICOs and without them we'll die! Get real dude.. 

Sure ICOs as a model have flaws, and the market is still figuring out how these things work. Bancor is proof that you have investors who don't perform their due diligence in regards to the tech that might be getting taken advantage of. But is that not the fault of the investor and not the philosophy of ICOs as a funding mechanism? Is this not something that the market, as it evolves and learns, will react to accordingly in the future? 

If you jump away from the ICO talk, and into the rest of his points, it gets even friggen worse. 

""Ethereum is not a store of value"" - duh and or hello. it never advertised itself as such, and I don't know anyone who's researched the tech who calls it that. 

""The EEA doesn't use Ethereum they us AN ethereum"" - yup they create sidechains and private chains. But if you paid attention to say, Conensus, you'd have heard folks from the EEA, like JPMC, who specifically mention that their side chains have to see integration with the Ethereum mainnet at some point. That it's good for the ecosystem, and for side by side development. So while they use ""an ethereum"" the plans for various levels of mainnet integration are already being worked on. Roadmaps and development, how do they work?",2017-06-14 23:44:38,diw9aqd,1,ethtrader

vander422,"I definitely agree that wealth inequality is a very scary trend that has been going on for quite a long time now. In regards to the bailouts, the FDIC insurance would have been a safety net, but that's not really what I am referring to. 

When Lehman Brothers failed, it created a massive shock in the financial system. The Dow dropped 500 points, pretty much every person is directly and indirectly affected by that. If AIG were allowed to fail I think it's safe to assume the devastation would have been much worse. I agree that it is a terrible thing when the government saves an institution and executives of that institution gave out bonuses, creating a moral hazard. However, in a lot of cases, executives were terminated, and shareholders lost all of their money. Who holds those shares? A lot of company executives. As the other commenter said, Bear Sterns was trading at $200/share at one point and was sold in a fire sale to JPMC at $2/share.",2017-05-28 07:14:19,di4myco,2,AskReddit
BeachJustic3,"Cloud providers are already trying to use blockchain, and Ethereum specifically, as a benefit to their service. MS Azure is treating Ethereum BCaaS as a model to adopt (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/ethereum-blockchain-as-a-service-now-on-azure/). There are so many fundamental uses of a system like Ethereum, that is has the capability to disrupt a lot of the foundations of what we call Web 2.0 (the current model of the internet). 

In my opinion things like swarm should terrify traditional cloud providers. If implemented correctly, you're giving communities the ability to make their own clouds using their own hardware, simply by agreeing to be a part of it at a communal level. Once some of the manageability issues of swarm are hammered out (like the inability to delete something when uploaded), people would be incentivized to abandoned something like Dropbox. I mean why wouldn't you? Participate in a swarm, get Eth for the storage you provide, and a cloud you can store on that MS/Amazon/Dropbox/Etc doesn't own. 

This sort of enablement of a new cloud model is huge to me, and just one of many potential use cases. This is before you get into the real meat and potatoes of enterprise uses. Supply chain systems, financial transactions, the standard stuff a block chain model can really benefit. The difference though is Ethereum, unlike most of the other chains, has the capability to go well beyond these sorts of transactions and cross into other realms. Cybersecurity is a realm that will benefit from blockchain enablement (https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2017/02/14/the-second-coming-of-blockchain)

We're not there yet, as a lot of development work has to happen. But it is well on it's way and a lot of major players like JPMC (Quorum) and SAP (Blockchain for Ariba http://www.ariba.com/about/press-releases/sap-ariba-gets-in-blockchain-game) are adopting these techs. We're nearing the tipping point, and Ethereum is already positioned as the go-to chain for these sorts of applications. 

So yes, we're on the verge of a technological revolution. But as far as changing the whole of the web? I'd venture a guess and say you're still 10 - 15 years from that. Ethereum still has to approach a scalability problem before that sort of thing can really occur, but I have faith in Vitalik. ",2017-05-27 01:43:12,di2vpoi,1,ethtrader

Turned out, in the dark of night, without allowing WaMu's board to prove the bank's solvency, JPMorgan Chase convinced the FDIC to raid WaMu, and immediately hand stewardship of all WaMu assets over to them. By the time the smoke cleared, WaMu wasn't insolvent, but it was way too late. A bank was literally stolen, investors defrauded, given pennies on the dollar for their investments, while JPMC became absolutely ""too big to fail"" and received bailouts without question or reason.

iamsarrah,"**Has anyone realised the increase number of rude nurses in RIPAS?**

A sensitive topic to discuss. I am aware that Bruneian patients sometime can be quite fussy and it ever happened before that a family has caused a huge scene to a particular nurse that made RIPAS hospital to take a measure to file a lawsuit to anyone who verbally or physically attacks the hospital staffs.

But don't you all think its so one sided? 

based from my own observation after having to visit the hospital for quite a number of times to pay a visit, I have come across some nurses being so ridiculously 'rude' like the way she/he uses the words to speak, the tone, the strength they use on the patients, sometimes even a tiny bit of inquiry, the reactions we get are unprofessionally answered(mad)

 
Typical Bruneians would ask anyone to go to JPMC or any private health centre if you plan to get a good treatment but this kind of mindset is ridiculous that will never bring our hospital to another level. RIPAS is the national hospital, the face of Brunei in healthcare. Having to see such a dozen of rude nurses are so disappointing.

I am aware that the job can really be tiring but that's the nature of being a nurse. Just like a salesperson having to deal with customers. It's sad to see other patients being treated roughly by some rude nurses.

2) Banking isn't like Apple or Pfizer whereby after initial ramp-up they pay sod all outside of employee taxes (but ask the surrounding bizs if they'd like to see those corps up sticks). Even with the reduced CGT rate (relative to income or 'official' corp tax rates) the likes of JPMC pay over plenty annually to taxman...which isn't even figured into that '1%'.

sanbox,"Pretty much. Honestly, there are very few people privy to the actual info on this. Memory is running out of supply due to mining operations running low (they have the factories to make them). Samsung would love to pump out more SSDs, but they literally can't get the precious metals to do it.

JPMC thinks it will pick up soon (and therefore lower prices) but who knows. 

Ignore people talking about collusion by the way. The non-volatile memory market is really alive and well and has both internal and external competition: there are even submarkets. Intel wants to crush Samsung with PCIE memory (and Intel got a big win by getting that memory in Macbooks) while Samsung wants to maintain their dominance in SATA and m.2 markets, and guys like Kingston just want to get more of a foothold. There's no reason to collude here: the pie isn't full yet, and there's no downside to undercutting since there's such a large potential market. Better to sell three 80 dollar SSDs rather than one 120 SSD. 

Moreover, the entire SSD market has a common enemy in the HDD market: relatively few companies manufacture both, so SSD makers have a huge incentive to decrease dollar per GB numbers so 1 TB and above SSDs can compete with HDDs, especially in the uber lucrative server market. Imagine if a single company supplied Google's petabytes of data storage: it would make all the money (I have no idea how Google stores or who supplies it for the record). 

What's limiting the market is supply, which is inhibiting the demand (""I won't pay that much for an SSD!!""). ",2017-05-05 00:26:27,dh4klox,65,buildapc

&gt;Of course, the regulators were missing some evidence, such as the Suspicious Activity Report that JPMorgan should have filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) but didn't. But hold on wait what:

&gt;In or about 1996, personnel from Madoff Bank 2 investigated the round-trip transactions between Madoff and the Private Bank Client. As a result of that investigation, which included meeting with representatives of Madoff Securities, Madoff Bank 2 concluded that there was no legitimate business purpose for these transactions, which appeared to be a ""check kiting"" scheme, and terminated its banking relationship with Madoff Securities. ... In addition, although unknown to JPMC at the time,¬†Madoff Bank 2 filed a SAR in or about 1996 identifying both Madoff Securities and the Private Bank Client as being involved in suspicious transactions¬†at Madoff Bank 2 and JPMC ""for which there was no apparent business purpose.""

&gt;That's paragraph 25 of the Statement of Facts (emphasis added). The details are a little boring,¬†but the point is that¬†in the mid-'90s¬†FinCEN got a Suspicious Activity Report detailing some of the naughty business that Madoff was doing at JPMorgan -- and that JPMorgan is now accused of covering up -- and, y'know, nothing happened. ""If only JPMorgan had filed a Suspicious Activity Report, we woulda caught Madoff!,"" say the regulators, extremely counterfactually.

Anyway, the first time I interned there was a very negative experience. I was stuck on a completely dysfunctional team whose product was so bad that they were basically stuck doing production support and never had the chance to catch up on their technical debt. To be perfectly honest I still don't know what the hell anyone on that team did...

But I ended up going back because it was convenient, since I could live at home and bank (aha!) all of my pay. My second experience was really good. I got to do exactly what I wanted (big data) and work on awesome team and made a bunch of great friends. In addition, my team was originally a separate company that got bought and integrated into JPMC so we were a lot more rogue than most groups in the company. Also if you're a returning intern they pay you more and since I was living at home I made just a hair short of what I would've made working at Google or Facebook.

Cranmanstan,"That big money you're thinking about is only going to be in major cities, where you won't have any space for a big house or any land.

Any place you can actually own a big house and land will be too far away from a major city to pay any type of decent salary. And you'll probably be amazed at the ridiculous taxes we pay to get nothing in return. They say it goes to the roads or something. 

Most of it actually goes to the bankers. Even our social safety networks, like food stamps, we actually pay the bankers more money to process those transactions than we actually pay out to people. JPMC is the biggest beneficiary of food stamps.

Franholio,"Some ideas:

-Massive barriers to entry. A bank would have to poach hundreds of staffers from a competitor to have a decent chance at developing and launching a premium card with no experience in that space.

-Increased competition kills profits for everyone. Look at how much Amex has had to offer on the Platinum to play catchup after Chase launched the CSR. This trend would only accelerate if another bank entered the market.

-Different risk models leading to more conservatism. Wells Fargo is one of the biggest residential mortgage providers in the market. For whatever reason, they've decided to employ their deposits towards more conservative lending. They probably assume, rightly or wrongly, that the credit card space is riskier than JPMC or Citi think it is.

IBMConsultant1992,"My experience and the majority of people I started with in CbD has not been good. IBM hardly does strategy work and the vast majority of the projects are IT implementation, which generally consist of testing, developing, and gathering requirements for software that IBM is building for their clients. Testing is mind numbingly boring and you're obviously not a developer, so you'll be competing for business analyst roles like 90% of the other people in CbD. I don't really even think I'd classify these as strategy roles.

If you accept the offer, I would avoid FSS like the plague. Financial services clients are the absolute worst to work for and I've not heard of a single ""strategy"" role involving these clients that's not a project managers assistant role. Places like Citi and JPMC aren't hiring IBM for strategy work, they hire places like Bain or McKinsey to do that.

As for the rest of your questions:

1) answered above. IBM doesn't have a reputation in the strategy department because they don't do a lot of work in this area.

2) Your salary is calculated based on your degree and where it came from.

3) It's *possible* in theory, but if you are doing actual strategy work you are in a small minority of CbDers

4) Of course it's what you make of it. The training is useless, and if you don't think of yourself as a good advocate for yourself / networker, then this job will be a nightmare for you.

5) If this is your only option, then I guess you have no choice but to accept. But I don't really think that CbD is inline with your goals unless you want to work here for 3 years and then go get an MBA.",2017-03-08 00:40:23,demfz17,1,IBM

If you look at what people like Daniel Pinto @JPMC are saying, it's about relocating the brass plaque, the legal status, rather than all operations. The UK is English-speaking, staff recruitment is expensive, redundancy is expensive, and commercial leases err on the long side. We're not going to see a total collapse overnight. 20% is decidedly not a small percentage, and logically the UK should remain part of the EU (because any deal the EU makes MUST be worse than full membership to avoid a stampede of exiting member states wanting that deal).

A lot of banks have been moving middle and back office work for a while, so some of that loss has already happened - because London is an expensive and inefficient city to host those jobs - so that will mitigate the net effect of Brexit as some was on the way regardless of the vote.

The EU allow Norway, Iceland and Lichenstein passporting rights without EU membership. It's not unprecedented. The UK is likely to push hard for a similar deal. Many on the other side - particularly the likes of Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem among others - will push back on that. Whether the UK gets passporting or not is in the big basket of nobody knows. Of course that EEA access requires recognising the supremacy of EU law which the UK govt sees as politically undesirable (though some MPs here are saying most of/all the voting was due to immigration).

Reduced regulation is possible if the UK doesn't have to abide by EU law which it won't if it doesn't get passporting.

masta,"So I'd say I'm an expert on passwords...... of course, who isn't, right? But no really, I am an expert.

So breaking this out:

&gt; Must be 8-32 characters long

8 chars in the lower/upper/number set is only 62^8 or 218,340,105,584,896 (trillions). Remember that length always trumps character set complexity. I think hashcat with a decent GPU can do like ~500k hash/s, and that is tractable to clustering GPUs for linear growth. To make it worse, that character space is already cracked and in databases, so effectively those passwords are already cracked (so long as you have access to unsalted hashes).

&gt; Must include at last one UPPERCASE, one lowercase and one number

These kind of rules do make sense,but ONLY for short passwords &gt;= 14 length range. After that the rules can be relaxed.

&gt; Must not have special characters or punctuation

For short passwords this kind of rule is considered harmful, however for longer passwords this kind of rule is workable.

&gt; Must be different than your previous five Passwords

Major red flag. In the worst case the implementation compares current candidate secret with wive the clear-text of previous secrets. In the best case it's just comparing the resulting hash.

&gt; Must not include your Email ID partly or fully

&gt; Must not include your First Name or Last Name

These are not entirely bad, but only in the context of short passwords. For long pass phrases it's totally fine to relax this rule.

&gt; Must not include more than 2 identical characters

This is considered harmful. It actually weakens the password complexity SIGNIFICANTLY. The adversary does not have to permutate anymore. 

&gt; Must not include more than 2 consecutive characters

Considered harmful. I'm not sure where this idea came from, and the reason that 2 identical (or more) characters is GOOD is because the adversary watching you type the password has difficulty seeing when you quickly double-tap a character. A quick double tap significantly makes shoulder-surfing more difficult. Also, it does not really reduce the complexity in any meaningful way. Remember length always trumps character set complexity.

&gt; Must not use the name of the financial institution (JPM, MORGAN, JPMORGAN, CHASE, JPMORGANCHASE, JPMC)

For short password preventing dictionary attacks makes sense, but when you go over 14 chars the idea of dictionary attacks is less significant.


In the past I've implemented a password policy like this:

* Must be over 20 characters

* must be all lower case

* no punctuation

* no numbers

* must contain at least one space char,

* space char may not  not appear at the beginning or end (sigh).

At first this policy enraged people, because it violated all the garbage password policy dogma they have ever known, until they realized they could create highly memorable pass PHRASES. The last rule was bolted on because I had a few hold-outs who refused to play, but I eventually removed it. If you really don't want to have a phrase, that's fine (and they used a password manager). Over time I actually relaxed all but the first rule, but for people new to pass phrases, unfortunately a weird rule like this totally makes sense.",2017-01-25 21:50:08,dcvwih0,1,sysadmin

SteveJEO,"It wouldn't be a bad thing.

It would however be an almost impossible thing for two fundamental reasons.

First. 

Russia really only wants one thing. (Putin especially) They want to west to fuck off and leave them alone so they can rebuild their country. Putin is hated personally by a lot because he refuses to allow russia and it's resources to be exploited by 'western entrepreneurs' (Goldman, JPMC, etc  ~ capital flight/resource 'redistribution'). 

You've heard the term: To the Victor, the spoils? Yes? 

Well, when the Soviet union fell it didn't quite work out like that and a lot of people are still really pissed about it. Russia is a literal goldmine and 'we' want it.

Second.

Though they aren't particularly interested in it themselves by remaining independent and relatively isolationist Russian enables direct competition. (and that's a big fat no no)

The russians really only export 2 things. Energy and weapons. Energy is money obviously but in this context it's actually a secondary concern. The real worry is their weapons technology. Even though they only export limited models (commonly referred to as the 'monkey models') the hardware they develop and export isn't a joke. It's unpleasantly effective and a real threat, especially to our power projection capability. ....and that's an issue because they both supply and form the foundation of the wests two biggest long term problems, India and China.

Without russia selling them shit the west could determine and limit both India's and Chinas potential to become long term competition by 'guiding' their defensive technology. With Russia in play we can't. 

Basically they're a linchpin state preventing the world from becoming truly unipolar and for that they gotta go.

runawaybruneian,"Hello! Wanted to see how this thread goes before I throw in some advice before jumping two steps ahead.

First, it is near impossible to get a job without first getting a PR, so that's top priority. If you're thinking of migrating or working abroad, it is most likely a first world country, and you have to keep in mind that you're competing against the rest of world. Getting a PR is in some ways like a job application, you put your application in and if you make the cut then you pass the first test. Now you have to compete for jobs with everyone who has been granted a PR, and this is where you need to shine. Nevertheless, having a PR will drastically increase your chances of getting a job but you have to have qualifications, work experience and exceptional English in the first place. You should not leave Brunei not until you get these two things sorted. Brunei might not have a bright future ahead but it is a pretty good place to save money for now, so maybe time to save those holiday and online shopping dollars and think about using that for migrating instead.

Second, if you want to cross this bridge, you have to realise that there is no looking back, no other option. To be successful, you will have to do this wholeheartedly and you need a combination of push and pull factors. For example, if you're feeling unappreciated and underpaid in Brunei, do try your chances abroad and hopefully, you will feel appreciated. There are many talented people in Brunei I admit; many will do well abroad. Most of us are thinking big cities, but do consider places that are outside the city where your skills and experience might play a vital role. Also, if you are from a close-knit family, I will advise against migrating unless you want to bring them over in future. Do note when you say 'working abroad', you have the intention of coming back and it is only temporary.

Third, the first few years will be tough. You will have trouble making ends meet, finding your place in society, face all sorts of new experiences (e.g. bigoted attacks, fear of crime) and some may even feel like they are all alone. Some people will adapt quickly but not everyone will. You may even feel at your lowest, but that is where you wake up and rebuild yourself. For example, you will feel the pressure of not having family around to take care of things while you are away.

These are the three things I tell my friends that ask me about migration. Hope this helps. To give some context, moved to Australia a few years ago, the PR process took a couple of months, it was pretty straightforward. ""departments to go to""? I believe you can do this on your accord without any intervention from any departments. Medical check for Australia is done at JPMC, very organised. All in all, cost a little bit of money but you make it back anyway. Feel free to ask any questions!

PM_ME_BOOBPIX,"Interesting point.  I see that you didn't put a timeline in your question (smart).

Let's see what we know are facts:

* sooner or later there will be a bear market. Cycles are part of life in Wall Street

* sooner or later there will be a bear marker (or a correction) worst that any bear market (or correction) on record

* we just don't know when, nor for how long.

* Donald Trump cabinet (not just him, but his cabinet as a whole) hold radical ideas for the economy and the future of the US, which will have ripple effect on the economy, therefore business, therefore the security markets. Some sectors will do better than during the Obama administration, some will do worse; it won't be business as we have experienced in the past 8 years.

* we have been experiencing historically extremely low interest rates for historically long period of time

* Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and it's a disruptive technology


Let's see the relevant questions for which we have no definite answer (aka speculations):

* Do we have a bubble?  And if so where is the bubble?

* Are any of the markets so overpriced that a correction is now due?

* Are there any fundamental systematic issues with the economy?

* What role will Cryptocurrencies play that will affect security markets?

My answers/prediction:

* Interest rates will eventually increase. I would not be surprised if [Prime Rate](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/historical-prime-rate.htm) will raise to the ~8% levels somewhere in the next 4-8 years

* The ripple effect of an increase in interest rate would be a correction and a bear marker in the Real Estate market

* Higher prices in consumer goods, non-discretionary; leading to decrease in disposable income.

So yes, there's a very good chance that we'll be facing a bear market in the near future, and possibly a correction. I also think that there will be unprecedented investment opportunities in certain sectors/securities. ",2017-01-15 22:09:48,dcgfaff,9,stocks

programmingguy,"Been investing in stocks since 2005. 2008 was not a big deal though everything got cut in half because I was young, distracted with enjoying life and work and generally ignorant on economics. I took for granted that  the stock market would recover because that's what everyone said when I started in 2005 so I  just keep buying because I was sold on dollar cost averaging when I was first introduced to investing over long periods. Statements came once a month in the mail and I never bothered to read them. I was a big believer in stock market investing back then but that was through mutual funds and since I didn't know much, I had a fixed amount get withdrawn from my account every month and sometimes I would top it if I bothered to open my account and had lot of cash in my savings account.

I think being young and ignorant at the time helped me to not pull the trigger after Lehman. Weird thing is I worked a few blocks from Lehman in an asset management firm and then JPMC  but didn't for one second worry about my job because I believed everything would get better. My older brother on the other hand who had started putting money into stocks with me took all his money out when he saw that he was breaking even to prevent further losses.

It's not US banks either.

&gt; It's interesting because I work with one of the top - if not the top - derivatives lawyers in the world and in his speeches on the subject he is very open about the fact that he and the banks were primarily at fault.

The diligence argument again. Political pressure trumped diligence.

It's interesting because I work with one of the top - if not *the* top - derivatives lawyers in the world and in his speeches on the subject he is very open about the fact that he and the banks were primarily at fault. That in fact the whole of the City and Wall Street - including the professional advisers - were at fault for failing to do proper due diligence on the securities they were issuing. 

In short - while your explanation of being forced to be competitive might be tempting to someone ideologically wedded to the idea of far right economics, it doesn't excuse the shoddy lack of due diligence that was conducted by the banks, the accountants, and the lawyers pre-2008 in regards to these securities. Being competitive does not involve buying fundamentally flawed products. 

We in the City don't need slavish devotion from ideologically driven apologists - we prefer now to learn from the mistakes and implement changes going forwards. Thankfully, a lot of change has come through as a result, from greater use of clearing houses to better DD procedures. If everyone just said 'oh well it wasn't our fault' then nothing actually gets fixed and we don't get better. ",2017-01-10 19:56:59,dc8lhh0,1,ukpolitics

grimview,"The context is that an employee of JPMC advertised a meetup located inside of the JPMC building &amp; used the JPMC job portal for a specific race of people; which doesn't sound inclusive to all &amp; could lead to discrimination in a hiring process. Its not the advertised meetup, but Only the job portal that claims its not a job, which is normal for ""job fair"". A corporation having a job fair (disguised as networking group) for specific race, is racist because it doesn't include all races. Its no different then historically oppressive signs that said Irish need not apply. Sure anyone any fill out the application, but after we meet you to visually verify your race, you just will not be hired. If you know a reporter, then sent it to the meet up find the proof you need.

ShadistsReddit,"Well... gods I don't know where to start with this.

&gt; Technically if we focus just on the meetup post, 

Sure, go ahead and ignore those pesky things like context and details, that's a good start to a considered opinion.

&gt; we realize that Terrance Bowman, is an employee of JPMC &amp; is promoting this as being ""FOR Blacks &amp; Hispanics"".

So? Is a networking event for a specific group somehow wrong? If he had a networking event for lefthanded audiophiles would that be as objectionable to you?

&gt; If this is not a job, then why is a non-job listed on an official JMPC job portal?

Well, should we continue to ignore the context of it NOT BEING A JOB? Because it seems your trip down outrage lane here requires it.

So, going by that: I'm going to guess that it's far easier to use a system already in place to set up a networking event than to reinvent the wheel to do so.

And just to make the point again, it says it's not a job. Flat out, no room for ambiguity.

&gt; Why does the meet up list job titles?

Two potential options. 1) it's giving people an idea what they mean when they say ""technology professionals"". And/or 2) giving people an idea what jobs they want to increase the applicants pool for when the time for getting people to apply comes.

&gt; What if Terrance is a racist &amp; involved in the hiring decision? With many pro-segregation identity groups gaining popularity is it possible that racist will be come more bold in trying to justify discrimination based on racial quotas in the same way Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer led illegal purge of male employees?

Wow... so much ""well what if SCARY THING!!!""

You go ahead and show me proof of any of that, at all, and then we'll talk.

&gt; Why shouldn't we spread awareness by voicing our concern?

Because to get to that point you have to actually ignore what's going on, read into things out of ignorance, and assume bad behavior with no proof at all. 

You have to fucking hand forge a chain of retarded supposition to get to the outrage.


So, until you actually have proof of any actual misdeeds, perhaps you shouldn't ""spread awareness"" because it makes you look like a conspiratard who's tilting at windmills.",2017-01-07 01:29:22,dc2ztte,1,KotakuInAction

lakerland13,"They'll probably remove the most convenient tooth to create the space that the rest of your teeth will need to make it aesthetically pleasing. 

Got mine done at JPMC about 4 years ago. I was deciding between JPMC or Miri. Like you said, government dental clinic has a long waitlist, so that was out. In the end decided to go with JPMC since its logistically easier. (You'll need to make monthly trips to the orthodontist to get your braces tighten) Also, before the Ringgit dropped the prices were somewhat similar. Might be different now. 

My experience was pretty straight forward. It was a minor issue. I had all 4 wisdom tooth taken out a year before, so didn't have to pull out anymore teeth. Having the braces put on was simple. Took about 15 minutes. Once on, your teeth would start to feel numb, and you would find it hard to bite for a day or two. Doesn't hurt though, just have this new sensation that takes some getting used to. First few meals were porridge and soup, stuff that doesn't require lots of biting. 

After a week of so, you'll get the hang of it and it pretty much back to normalcy from there, albeit just taking care of your teeth a little more. As mentioned before, you'll have monthly appointments to get your braces tighten and checked. On that day itself, your teeth would feel numb for awhile, but it's no problem. 

Some tips:
1) Brush your teeth after meals if you can. The better you take care of your teeth, the easier the whole process will be, as you wouldn't have any complications (cavity, toothache etc) 
2) Don't bite too hard on food. You'll risk snapping your braces in which case would set you back for a month. Eat and chew slower on harder foods (apples, meat with bones etc)",2016-12-29 14:09:06,dbqwfez,1,Brunei

antiics,"&gt; 1 - The project has no business common sense whatsoever.

I think this is an unfair characteristic. The ETH foundation is a research organization. The main thrust of the ETH Foundation is to get developers building on ETH and to write specs for future releases of the technology. By those metrics they are wildly successful. There are 7 implementations of the protocol, and plenty of smart contract developers sprouting up. 

Furthermore teams like Jeff Wilcke's are pairing with industry leaders such as JPMorgan Chase to jointly develop solutions like Quorum. A commercial partnership with JPMC requires some savvy. Roman and EtherCamp announced their partnership with Santander at DevCon2. The list goes on. 

&gt; 2 - There is no semblance of best accepted engineering practice whatsoever on the Ethereum project. Changes are willy-nilly implemented without testing that have cascading unintended consequences.

Move fast and break stuff :) Ethereum is blazing ahead to its stated goal of PoS and Sharding. It will probably require a complete re-write by the time Eth2.0 is created. The protocol code is definitely very well tested (https://github.com/ethereum/tests - 1,000 commits!). Sure, new issues arise and things break. That's true of software. However, in the places where it counts, there have not been any catastrophic explosions. ETH has had 100% uptime since Genesis.

&gt; 3 - There is no accountability for the leadership, no method to show that the community matters as far as voting goes (i.e. compared to something like decred), and a fanboy userbase mentality along with a rubberstamping ""foundation"" leaving one genius at the top of the pile who's own intelligence and lack of enterprise engineering experience and executive or operations background who is essentially a loose cannon that can destroy the entire enterprise accidentally at any time- and not even really care necessarily.

The Foundation could probably do a better job of this, but at the same time all of the code is GPGL. Nothing is stopping people who are dissatisfied with the rubberstamping from creating improvements on their own. Not sure where the ""destroying the entire enterprise"" stuff comes from. Care to elaborate? (There are many instances of enterprises using ETH)

&gt; 4 - There are no seasoned business, technical, or financial minds that have any real say-so in the adminstration of the project.

Is that true of many crypto projects? There's certainly an aspect of ""innovating as an outsider"" going on here. Afterall, after 20+ years with the internet, no Enterprise created a blockchain. It's really impressive where the project has come in such short order as compared to other mainstream business technical initiatives.

&gt; 5 - There is no concept of the consequences of breaching values, such as non-censorship, fungibility, etc. that have come to define blockchain maxims.

Probably true from an investor perspective. However Ethereum is a highly experimental project whose goal is to disrupt blockchain maxims (PoS for example). Caveat emptor.

&gt; 6 - There is a sense of painting oneself into the corner with things like the difficulty bomb for a forced move to PoS without a thorough testing platform. Once PoS is irreversible, one bug in the PoS stewardship method for vested nodes that starts stealing money will render the entire project completely worthless

While ""completely worthless"" is an extreme position to take, there is definitely risk in PoS. As such, it should be thoroughly tested, vetted, audited, etc. And if it works? That's a big coup for the ETH foundation.

&gt; 7 - There is conflict of interest demonstrated with the DAO bailout, identify of white hat hacker group, how ETC funds were managed, indifferent attitude towards Slock.it's sins in creating DAO debacle, which is not resolved. For all intents and purpose there is no Ethereum Foundation. Nobody know how much money is left or what the spent funds have been used on. The fact is that ETC, Ethereum Classic, may be the saving grace of the entire effort if these potential tragedies are not prevented. Anyone can fork a new currency (see ZEC and ZCL), that is not the reason why ETH is completely failing.

Shrug? ETC consists of groups of speculators, maximalists, and Chinese miners who have no interest in blockchains migrating to Proof of Stake as it removes their bread basket. The ETH foundation brought Ethereum to the world. DAO was a mistake, but it was reverted (by the way - the DAO revert wasn't a ""bail out""... not a single ETH user took a haircut). That revert upset maximalists and now we have ETC. Okay great...ETC exists and that's okay - permissionless innovation at its finest. However saying ""for all intents and purposes there is no Ethereum Foundation"" is hysterical. Of course there is an EF and the industry is continuing to rally around it. There are photos of Vitalik and Satya Nadella having conversations. V is a Thiel Fellow. There's a lot of support behind the work Ethereum is doing.

My advice to you /u/hiranyakasipu is to rationalize your thoughts, tone down your rhetoric and focus on your strong points without leaning on things like ""diapers"" and ""mom's basements"". No wonder you're getting downvoted.

Crypto is a risky bet. It always has been. Ethereum is, and will remain, the most innovative blockchain platform out there. It's barely over a year old. The genesis block for Bitcoin was January 2009. That means ETH is essentially the same place BTC was in May 2010. Had you heard of BTC in 2010? My guess is definitely no.

CountNarcula,"I worked at JPMC as a summer tech analyst for two summers in NYC. To be frank, I do not think if you're passionate about technology you should not make one of the large finance firms (Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JPM, etc. ) your top choice.  I loved the social attitude that one of my teams had, and I became good friends with a lot of the interns.  However, I always felt like the front office folks just saw you as glorified IT instead of a contributing developer, and the projects were mind numbing. Also, the average age there is around 40, so people are still pushing old technologies like Oracle DB, Sharepoint, Lotus Notes etc. so you don't get to use a lot of the tech being used as current industry standards. However, I do think a lot of the Big 4 tech companies look at internships at financial firms favorably, and some of the interns that I knew are now devs at Microsoft/Amazon. Let me know if I can answer any more questions for you! ",2016-12-04 21:41:47,darscl7,2,cscareerquestions

The general consensus is, you won't be doing super cool stuff. You will most likely be untangling some old spaghetti code or doing some minor tweaks here and there. Maybe build some small internal app with a team of other interns. They hire so many people that only like 5% of the people got a project that was actually challenging and fun in terms of tech.  

You have to remember that they are banks first and use technology to help them with financial and bank stuff. You are not going to be working with the best people and you are not going to be working on the next big thing.

If you are not ""passionate"" about technology, as in, you are good, but don't care what you do, just get the $$$, its perfect. Good hours, good pay, nice bonuses, just a bit boring.

PAJW,"Let's just say we woke up one morning in 2013 and found out JP Morgan Chase had failed. JP Morgan Chase is one of the banks that is ""too big to fail.""

One of the most effective tools in the 2008-09 crisis was forcing shotgun weddings of ""bad banks"" with ""good banks"". But there is no one who could absorb JP Morgan Chase. It's just too big.

JP Morgan Chase (I'll refer to them as JPMC for brevity) is so large that its failure would cause the FDIC insurance fund to dwindle from $77 billion into the negative, overnight. Presumably that would trigger Congress to pass emergency legislation to bail out the FDIC, but while that worked its way through the government depositors may or may not believe their money is safe.

Depositors would find out that the FDIC was being bailed out and wonder if their deposits were safe at other banks. Some would undoubtedly pull their funds out.

This is where things get fuzzy with the prognostication. If JPMC had failed, how broad are the shockwaves?

The very idea that JPMC had failed would send a shockwave through the banking industry, as investors and depositors know that whatever catastrophic mistake JPMC had made could be made by any of the other megabanks, or indeed also by smaller banks.

Certainly the failure of a bank as large as JPMC would cause some kind of a hiccup in the broader economy, while the banks froze any new loans while they try to figure out what is going on and whether they have a problem they also need to face.

-----

Because the banking industry is based largely on confidence, it is very hard to say definitively what would happen. Policy makers tend to focus on preventing the worst case, so we often don't find out what actually happens.

Some have pointed out that Iceland did not bail out its banks in the 2008-09 crisis, and did not suffer armegeddon. I don't know much about the Icelandic response specifically, but I do know that the Icelandic Krona suffered a severe change in exchange rate during the crisis. The exchange rate has somewhat normalized in recent years, although the Krona is substantially weaker against the USD or the Euro than it was before the crisis.",2016-11-28 09:48:45,daie30u,3,explainlikeimfive

notwhoithink,"&gt; They called (not sure if same number) and within 5 minutes on hold were told to tell me that within 24-48 hours I'd receive an email from JP Morgan Chase and at that point I'd enter my account info. Within 3 days after that the funds would be in my account. 

I'll have to review the settlement documents again, because this sounds like another violation.  My understanding is that they were required to submit funds to us either via check or within 3 days.  Giving JPMC 1-2 days and then taking another 3 days beyond that isn't what we signed up for.

a012189,"I know, I think dress codes are really interesting and so much more complicated than just a simple set of rules! 


We are all technically client facing, but we don't see clients every day (although they can randomly pop in for meetings in the office where they would see anyone who walks by). The higher you move up, the more you'll interact with clients until you're high up enough that you are the main point of contact and manage the entire project for your client. I think, at least in my company, there's an implicit understanding that being predictably professional, where your boss won't have to worry that you'll do something embarrassing in front of a client, is part of the criteria for upward mobility. And the way you conduct yourself within the office ends up being the basis for how your bosses think you're going to act outside of the office, in front of clients. Dressing within the norms of our office (which is more lax than the industry at large), whether because it's your style or because you observe what more senior members of the firm are signalling as appropriate and purposefully conforming to that, signals that you will do that same thing when you get put in front of clients. Because it doesn't really matter to my boss if I think black lipstick is fine, or FFA thinks its fine, what matters is whether the group of 6 old white dudes sitting across the table from us at JPMC think its fine...because they're the ones that hire us. Dress isn't the end all be all of upward mobility, obviously, but pretty much anything that might make the firm look unprofessional in the eyes of clients is a no no. 


I definitely do think dress codes will relax as younger generations grow up and are in positions of authority but who knows how much. I think people use dress as one way to display authority and what that looks like may change...I'm less convinced on whether that concept will go away or whether the norm will just look different 20 or 30 years from now.",2016-11-16 05:10:52,da1swjv,8,femalefashionadvice

ryeshoes,"It's saying that charges are the responsibility of the sender. Here's an example:

Incoming wire to Canada in USD is routed through JPMC prior to crediting the Canadian financial institution. The sender pays their bank a fee to send money, and JPMC takes some amount (say, 20$) for their trouble. The beneficiary receives x-20$ to their account.

In theory, the 20$ fee needs to be paid for by the sender. If they want the beneficiary to get 1000$ they must send a wire for 1020$ (or 1000$+ all fees)

The beneficiary might be charged additional incoming wire fees from their financial institution but those fees are secondary to the incoming wire and more importantly are not deducted from the amount credited to the account",2016-11-03 08:23:55,d9j738g,2,Banking

AnnoyingOwl,"&gt; Frustratingly, it neglected to explain JP Morgan's training program that the guy was hired into.

I can tell you all about that hiring program. It's a cottage industry, served by companies willing to relocate Indian programmers with very little skill or local non-developers desperate to get into a development job.

In the case of both types of developers, they teach them the very basics of what they'll need to answer in the JPMC interviews to get hired, spending more time drilling them on their own internal database of questions that JPMC has asked then teaching them actual useful programming skills.

The companies that sell these people then take a large cut of an already below industry average salary out of the pay checks of those hired.

There are, perhaps, some areas of JPMC that are not like that, but it's hard to imagine. Almost every developer I met (and this was non-investment bank people, IB guys are scientists/geniuses not developers and definitely not HackReactor types) was either hopelessly out of touch or hopelessly green, and almost always incompetent. Anyone with a shred of competency left almost immediately.

However, getting overtime is up to how well you do, since your manager probably won't let you do overtime if you aren't producing. ",2016-10-11 05:00:14,d8me8z8,1,cscareerquestions

Most people here say ""they don't care about millennials because it's not their core audience""...they care. Amex is built around card services and if they don't attract millennials soon, they will fall quickly. They aren't like JPMC who can depend on other business units when card services has a rough few years. CSR showed the industry that millennials are open to paying for a high-end card and will recommend peers do the same - this move by Amex does virtually nothing for a majority of that young target audience.

I think your assumption that these seniors did not get interviews due to poor performance in a previous cycle is overreaching. These are returning applicants who now have full-time experience and have been validated by the return offers they received from Big 4. Furthermore, this trend is widespread enough that I doubt all of these students were previously dinged for terrible performance.

By contrast, these bankers are recruiting because they did not get return offers from JPMC, GS, MS. I don't think a lack of an offer should be interpreted as an implicit stamp of approval.

A friend of mine who was with JPMC, IBD, FIG this summer attended an OW superday today - 14 interviewees total, 13 were ex-banking, 1 was from Harvard who interned with Bain and didn't receive a return.

It's true that hospital is not a hotel but at least provide a proper room for visitors to wait or stay over. There's no need of providing a bed, it is better to provide a room than letting the family all over the place along the walkway. It's hideous.

This kind of ""if you need a full service go to JPMC"" mindset will never make RIPAS get any better. RIPAS is the nation's hospital. More than 50% of Bruneians life depends on it.

Usually hospital visitors are limited to 1 or 2 to maintain the peace inside wards and not impede operations (like can you imagine if you knocked over a vial of blood/fluids ?) Also bruneians have a habit of having the entire family over , where in the west it's always just 1 or 2 visitors for patients any one time (instead of the entire extended family crowding the bed)

There is also a visitors room or centre, where you get to sleep and camp. But if you choose to be near the patient and sleep outdoors, then you can't expect the hospital to provide you beds.

Tldr. It's a hospital and its for patients. Not a hotel for visitors. 

To be fair I haven't seen the picture that you are talking about, but I can imagine and have experienced spending time at the hospital before. And it's just fine. Like. What do you expect when you are paying $3 for the hospital to deliver your baby ?  I was quite satisfied with my experience at Ripas and I can tell you I'm not an easily satisfied person.

You want full hotel service then just go JPMC and stay over at Empire and pay tens of thousands for it. Also have nice horses to look at and you can play golf if your bored.

Or really just eat a healthy diet and exercise and not be obese like more than 50% of the bruneian population, and then suffer from diabetes or kidney failure. No hospital and national health policy is going to be able to handle those rates of diabetes, kidney failure and obesity - only education and prevention - which again they've done a decent job at.

And yeah, people have looked. There's a research paper out there by a couple of engineers basically asserting that this has been happening in every national election since 2000. And it swung every election, a bit. Couldn't overcome landslides, but they likely forced Romney into play when he wouldn't have been the primary choice, and they gave McCain a boost. And Hilary, last time and now. This is probably the first race, since 2000, where this tactic has actually resulted in the candidate they (whoever is doing this) wanted- assuming HRC wins.

And before you get all worried about tinfoil hats- again, others have done research into what it would take to accomplish exactly what I'm describing. The answer: precious little. The hacking is child's play, and primaries are staggered. 3-4 people could do it, over a 2-3 month road trip. Maybe 8 on national Election Day, because you still would choose only a couple of battleground states in which to swing things.

MAN! That would be the ticket!

They were forced to pay it back with interest...

They also have lost their ass on most of those forced purchases.  Look up the loses and fines that BoA has had to cover because of Countrywide and Merrill?  Countrywide alone has cost BoA over 50BN...  Which is a hell of a lot more than the TARP money they received and paid back with interest...

&gt;Again, bad business practices need to bring about failures if our markets are supposed to work for the public good, at all (which obviously is, nor has ever been, the first concern of Wall Street.)

The banks that were engaging in bad business went out of business...  The banks that were left were the smart ones.  BoA, JPMC, Wells, PNC...  The banks that went down were the ones that made the bad decisions(Bear, Lehman, Merrill, WaMU, Wachovia, NCC).

&gt;So? That didn't bring jobs back, it didn't help people get out of the debt foisted on them by presidents, mortgage lenders, and Wall Street. 

It sure as hell kept more jobs than would have been lost otherwise...

What do you think would have happened if TARP never happened?

Also any debt was ""foisted"" on themselves...

&gt; If the end point of capitalism isn't monopolies that set the price of everything and plumb our money sources at the expense of our health, well being and lives, then golly gee the government shouldn't have to bail out any financial institution.

If you think our financial markets are based on pure capitalism you are deluding yourself...  The primary culprit of the 08 crisis was bad government intervention into the market...(between Fannie and Freddie, the CRA, the FED)

&gt; Diversification and competition should easily solve the issue...except the end point is always monopolization and Too Big To Fail, ain't it. So let's all pledge allegiance to Big Corp and Wall Street already.

You are conflating crony capitalism, with bad/over regulation with actual capitalism...

PS You are arguing for less diversification in financial markets by wanting smaller more focused banks.

&gt;The part that let banks become participating entities with Lehman in a huge financial boondoggle where, so sad, Lehman just wasn't huge enough to be too big to fail.

Which part of the deregulation did that... Asking you for actual specifics is like pulling teeth on a cat.  Basically impossible.  All you have are baseless statements that have no basis on reality.

&gt;Ain't it convenient that you never blame the relationship between corporate partners as a element of the essential corruption of the real estate market, the relationships that Clinton allowed to become so huge, so unregulated, that it created an inevitable failure.

That relationship had been legal under GS....

&gt;Risk for whom exactly? Oh sure, the corps of Wall Street. For us, diversification is the only way to protect what few assets we have.

What are you even arguing for here...  Your statement is contradictory.

You do know that universal banking is based on diversification right?

Edit: I just saw in another post you claimed that GS was committing fraud by combined risky mortgages and rating them AAA.  So yea, thanks for confirming that you have no clue what diversification is.

Those taxpayor investments went to having them buy up the failing banks, not because they needed the money.  JPMC, Wells, BoA didn't need the money and were the safest banks during the crisis.  Their size is what allowed us to get out of the crisis by the fed forcing them to be the firemen buying up all the junk.  All of the junk was the pure commercial banks and the pure investment banks.

Travelers was an insurance conglomerate that owned Solomon Smith Barney, an Investment Bank.  GS prevented the merger of Commercial and Investment banks.  Citi was a Commercial Bank.  Thus it would have been banned.  This is very simple.

&gt;Quit projecting flawed ideological beliefs I don't share. I pointed out many of the business practices in the GLB ACT citation I gave you above. You would have recognized it if you took the time to read my citations.
You want a laundry list of idiocy that GLB unleashed? No problem...reckless lending practices, securitization of mortgages, use of Fannie/Freddie as toxic loan dump sites, shifting business risk to U.S. taxpayers, recklessly speculating with investor/depositor/taxpayer money, marginalizing antitrust laws and creating financial institutions that pose systemic threats in the process, insuring investment risks without federally mandated loan loss reserves (i.e., credit default swaps), over-leveraging bank capital, reckless and counterproductive commodity speculation, etc., etc.

All would have been legal under Glass-Steagall....

Mortgages were being securitized as far back as the late 1970s.  ""Reckless lending"" aka originating mortgages has always been a primary action of Commercial banks.  As for marginalizing anti-trust laws, banks are subject to some of the strictest anti-trust laws before and currently. etc etc.  Your list reads like a 15 years olds understanding of the 08 crisis and thinking that all of it was banned pre-GLB...

&gt;You're talking about neoliberal Friedman fan-boys. It's what the U.S. economic community has largely become since Reagan was elected. Bernanke's response to the Financial Crisis was straight out of Milton Friedman's neoliberal playbook.

Bernanke is part Friedman and part-neo keynesian...  Besides being a fan of Friedman is not a rebuke...  

In your all knowing mind, what should have Bernanke done?

&gt;As for the banking industry's denials, that self-serving behavior does not refute what Fed Chairman Bernanke pointed out in the least. If it did, he and the country wasted $trillions by pouring taxpayer money into the financial industry since 2008 and COUNTING. The logic and judgment you are employing on this matter is beyond flawed.

By ""wasted"" do you mean paid back with interest like TARP was?  Or do you mean the massive profits that the FED(and by extension Treasury) has made off of QE?  Or do you mean the tens of Billions in interest that the Government has saved through having lower interest rates from QE?

Which of those ""wasted"" do you mean?

&gt;That's neoliberal theoretical nonsense talking. If you were paying attention to U.S. trade history post-Free Trade, you would have come to realize that the absence of tariffs unleashes every form of global trade cheating imaginable. It has also greatly diminished the U.S. economy and most Americans in the process. 

Yea you are going to need to back up this bullshit.  Freer trade has been a massive success for all Americans.  It has led to more choice and cheaper goods for all income levels.  If you are trying to blame trade for fewer manufacturing jobs you should check yourself.  Those job losses are due to automation.  We produce more than ever with a much much smaller workforce due to automation.

&gt; Those consequences began to manifest themselves the moment Republicans instituted Free Trade during Reagan's second term in office, and have grown exponentially following the passage of NAFTA. 

NAFTA has been a huge success...

&gt;Outside of that history, the U.S. did not endure the incessant trade wars you claim result from U.S. tariffs prior to Free Trade. So, that argument lacks any merit whatsoever based on this nation's actual economic history in trade.

Maybe because if you look at our nations history in trade, you would see us moving towards freer and freer trade over the past 80 years.  The last time we tried to push protectionism the result was a massive trade war that was a primary cause of the Great Depression.

&gt;That's denial talking since you have yet to prove that financial industry deregulation didn't culminate in the Financial Crisis.

I can't prove something to someone who won't listen like you...

I have shown multiple times that the primary actions that led to the crisis were all allowed pre-GLB.  I have also shown how without GLB the crisis would have been worse.

&gt;Remember, the burden of proof is as much on you in this debate.

It is more so on you, since I am proving a negative.  I can only show that the actions that caused the crisis were allowed pre-GLB which I have already done.

&gt;If that argument were remotely true, the financial industry wouldn't have spent the effort and $millions on deregulation efforts. The financial industry is largely led by conniving and manipulative white collar crooks, not complete idiots. They wouldn't exopend that money and energy unless it unilaterally benfitted them to do so.

Ahh talk about a bit of bias here!!!

&gt;Consolidation of the financial industry along with the widespread, counterproductive business practices that consolidation unleashed. Go ahead, deny those consequences too since you're on a roll.

The financial industry was in consolidation mode since the 1950s and those business practices you listed were all allowed pre-GLB.

&gt;Are you seriously as clueless about the impact of financial industry deregulation as that incessant denial suggests? That's not a random statement. The financial industry was legally prohibited from scores of proprietary investments prior to deregulation.

You need to show what they were prohibited from owning and also show how that led to the crisis...

Do you not understand what point you are trying to make?

Your point is that deregulation led to the crisis.  Not that deregulation led to banks being able to do things.

&gt;Being around in theory and being widely practiced/sold/used is NOT the same thing. 

They were not only around in theory but widely available as well!!(also, being around in theory would destroy your argument that they were banned from doing them).

Hell the ""father"" of MBS created them in 1977 and brought them to the market as a mainstream investment in the mid 1980s.  MBS basically built Salomon Brother into one of the most successful I Banks of the 80s.

&gt;If you are suggesting that securitized mortages and credit default swaps were as widely available and traded prior to deregulation of the 1990's, you're flat out lying about that history

I am not claiming that... Changing the goal posts much?  I am claiming that they were just as legal then.  We are discussing legality, not size of the market...

&gt;As someone who worked in real estate financing in the mid-1980's, I have no problem whatsoever calling bullshit on such claims.

As the Queen of England I have not problem calling bullshit on your claims.

&gt;Dubya's TARP initiative destroyed your unfounded argument. Wise up!

Not at all... 

&gt;By ""they"" you mean Wells Fargo only. The proper pronoun to use in this case was ""it"", NOT ""they"" as Bernanke proved in his testimony.

So one guy's testimony ""proves"" something? Why does Jamie Dimon's Testimony not count?  Or are you about to engage in another genetic fallacy?

&gt;Unless, of course, you want to accuse Bernanke of being a national embezzler for giving the financial industry $trillions of taxpayer money they never should have gotten. Is that what you are seriously inferring there?

The Reason Bernanke forced the banks to take the money was because they were forcing them to buy up all of the junk on the market.  On their own JPMC and GS and BoA did not need the money.  They did how ever need the money to buy and cover the losses from the purchases of Bear, Merrill, Wachovia, WaMu, NCC, etc etc.

Also, this completely ignores the fact that QE and TARP made a ton of money for the government in both direct revenue and indirect cost avoidance. ",2016-08-22 20:58:28,d6rs7vg,1,politics
ice_raptor,"&gt;Why? (should shadow banking have been shut down)

I'll let one of the financial industry executives responsible for Glass Steagall repeal (i.e., the more experienced and knowledgeable one...former Citibank/Citigroup CEO John Reed) explain [why the pursuit of Universal Banking was a tragic mistake](https://www.ft.com/content/255fafee-8872-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896).  If you hit a FT paywall with that citation, here's [an alternate citation on the same subject](http://www.businessinsider.com/john-reed-problem-with-big-banks-2015-11).  Take good notes of Reed's sound observations because he's absolutely correct on the matter of financial industry deregulation.  John Reed is one of the few trustworthy, old school bankers left.

&gt;Also, GLB did not touch the insurance industry?

Citibank's proposed merger with Travelers could never have transpired while GS was still in place.  Citigroup's formation post-Glass Steagall repeal soundly refutes the theory you're proposing on the matter.  It was why Treasury Secretary Bub Rubin and his subordinate Larry Summers pushed for deregulation.  They both had hidden agendas for championing that agenda...Rubin became one of Citigroup's Chairmen post-repeal and Summers cut his own sweetheart career deals.

&gt; Why? (should Clinton have vetoed Gramm's deregulation initiatives)...What would it have changed?...What would have happend in 2008 without GLB?

First, it would have prevented the restoration of counterproductive business/economic practices that culminated in the Financial Crisis and great diminishment of the U.S. economy.  Second, the Financial Crisis never would have occurred because the regulatory safety measures built into the Glass Steagall Act and other financial industry laws/regulations outlawed the practices, leveraging and financial instruments at the heart of the Financial Crisis.  Keep in mind that Gramm's deregulation efforts gutted banking laws and recklessly loosened other laws/regulations that governed and once restricted market participation by the financial industry, capital leveraging, derivatives and use of government/taxpayer money.

&gt;You do realize that the stock market crash did not cause the Great Depression right? The great depression was caused by a combination of things, including tightening fed policy in deflationary periods, protectionism, and drought.

I'm aware of all the factors that caused the Great Depression, but the financial industry and reckless speculation were at the heart of it contrary to Milton Friedman's ideologically-driven demagoguery on that history. 

The Fed was only about 15 years old when the 1929 stock market crash occurred.  So, it had neither the expertise, experience nor tools to fully address deteriorating economic conditions as you might be assuming there.  The Smoot-Hawley Act worked as designed up until it cratered trade with Europe.  They went too far by tripling tariff rates, but the arguments we hear from Free Trade advocates these days in support of jettisoning all tariffs is equally as reckless and stupid.  As usual, effective U.S. trade policies are in the middle of the two economic extremes and revolve around what the U.S. maintained pre-Free Trade (i.e., tariff rates around the mid-20% range that revolved around leveling market differentials NOT mercantilism).  The Dust Bowl/drought you're referring to there was a consequence of reckless agricultural speculation that the financial industry fueled.  It was tied to higly speculative business practices/investments and the market collapse.  Sound familiar to the Housing Bubble?

Here's [some financial industry background](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2002/200211/200211pap.pdf) you might find interesting since it reveals the inherently suicidal nature of the financial industry and what gave rise to JP Morgan's push for the Federal Reserve after [the Financial Panic of 1907](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-financial-panic-of-1907-running-from-history-82176328/?no-ist).  To quote Yankee Great Yogi Berra, ""It's like deja vu all over again"". 

&gt;Citi was the only mega bank that was at risk. The rest of the mega banks were the safest(JPMC, WF, and BoA).

Bernanke's testimony soundly refutes that belief.  The only bank you listed that was not at risk was Wells Fargo from what I've been able to glean by researching that history.

&gt;What actions did GLB allow that caused the crisis?

Here's [an overview of what GLB aimed to achieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley_Act) and here's [an overview of what resulted from it](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ross_levine/papers/Autopsy-4-13.pdf), causing the Financial Crisis.  Keep in mind that the Financial Crisis was caused by many financial industry deregulation efforts in addition to GS repeal.  Would the Financial Crisis have occurred in the absence of those misguided deregulation efforts?  Not a chance!

&gt;What actions of Bear or Lehman were banned by GS that GLB allowed?

Their reckless speculation, use of financial derivatives and excessive capital leveraging would never have been allowed.  Bear Stearns and Lehman had leverage ratios close to where Gramm raised capital leveraging when they collapsed.  

That's what sank both of those firms and posed an existential threat to AIG, Merril Lynch and the rest of the Financial Industry.  It's why [former CFTC Chair Brooksley Born warned Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Larry Summers, Bob Rubin and others not to recklessly deregulate the commodity markets as they were hellbent on doing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/25/AR2009052502108.html).

&gt;What actions of Bear or Lehman were banned by GS that GLB allowed? 

Stop honing in on GS alone and look at the entirety of financial modernization/deregulation efforts that Phil Gramm and Congressional Republicans championed.  If you don't, you'll never wrap your head around the problems I'm pointing out or come to truly understand the issues involved.  Glass Steagall is one of the primary linchpins that caused the Financial Crisis, but it's not the only one.  Delve into the other deregulation efforts put in place, some of which I touched on above.  One area I didn't touch upon, but deserves a lot of attention is financial industry ownership, speculation and investment in the market/economy.  This was never meant to be allowed because it distorts how the market functions due to the conflicts of interest created.

&gt;How about Wachovia, NCC, or WAMU? How about AIG?

In and of itself, mortgage lending isn't problematic if done correctly.  The problem in this instance is that safe mortgage lending practices were converted into reckless gambling by financial derivatives, like CDO's/mortage backed securities and credit default swaps (aka investment insurance which SHOULD have mandated loan loss reserves), which deserve to either be outlawed or severely restricted once again.  Why?  They turn largely harmless and beneficial banking practices into overleveraged financial bombs.
 
&gt;Were at risk... Did you even read your quote?

Yes.  I stand by what I wrote.  Bernanke was referring to the imminent risk of failure (aka existential threat), not normal business risk.  Accountants would regard Bernanke's views as recognition of ""going concerns""...aka the financial ""kiss of death"".

&gt;Also do you remember how the combined mega banks were also the FEDs firemen during the crisis with the Feds forcing JPMC, WF, BoA, and PNC to buy up all of the junk?

Take a hard look at where the money came from to complete those transactions since those banks didn't have it at that time.  If they did, the federal government would not have needed to unilaterally fund the auto industry bailout too.

&gt;Also, which of the combined mega banks failed?

Those banks didn't fail because the Fed pumped $trillions into them both in 2008 and since that time post-Financial Crisis to keep them afloat.  It's what Fed QE and current interest rates are aimed at achieving.  We know that capital didn't come from U.S. consumers who have been tapped out over recent decades.  The problem with Fed capital infusions is that there's no way to draw those trillions out of the market without causing widespread economic problems in the absence of a fully restored U.S. labor market.  What's worse is that the Fed's economic charade can't be sustained indefinitely.  As we speak, the stock market is overinflated by Central Bank money.  Talk about a ticking economic bomb...

&gt;...the only reason that banks were at risk of failure was how interconnected they were Glass-Steagall did nothing to prevent their interconnectedness.

Glass-Steagall and Reagan era deregulation efforts (i.e., banking deregulation and Sherman Antitrust Act marginalization) largely created the ""inter-connected"" financial industry you are referring to there.  GS repeal magnified that problem significantly.  Keep in mind that reckless deregulation efforts by neoliberals in both parties go all the way back to Richard Nixon's election in 1968.",2016-08-20 12:12:13,d6p0qlc,1,politics
AceOfSpades70,"&gt; The sane response to shadow banking was NOT to eliminate the few regulatory measures that were in place. Instead, the sane and sensible legislative response to shadow banking was to shut those banking and insurance industry practices down...HARD. 

Why?

Also, GLB did not touch the insurance industry?

&gt;He should have vetoed Phil Gramm's ""financial antiquation"" efforts at every turn regardless of whether Republicans could have overridden it or no

Why?

What would it have changed?

What would have happened in 2008 without GLB?

&gt;Because they only served to restore the reckless business practices that ushered in the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and Great Depression.

You do realize that the stock market crash did not cause the Great Depression right?  The great depression was caused by a combination of things, including tightening fed policy in deflationary periods, protectionism, and drought.  Not a stock market crash.  Hell the banking runs occurred 4 years after the crash anyways.

&gt;Again, this is utter nonsense. Glass Steagall paved the way for Universal Banking, where the lines that one delineated insurance, commercial banking and investment banking industries were significantly eliminated. It's what made Citigroup possible.

Citi was the only mega bank that was at risk.  The rest of the mega banks were the safest(JPMC, WF, and BoA).

What actions did GLB allow that caused the crisis?  What actions of Bear or Lehman were banned by GS that GLB allowed?  How about Wachovia, NCC, or WAMU?  How about AIG?

&gt;As Ben Bernanke testified before the Financial Crisis Committee investigating the causes of the Financial Crisis, 12 of the 13 major banks were within weeks of failure. That admission from the Fed Chairman destroys the argument you just made.

Were at risk... Did you even read your quote?

Also do you remember how the combined mega banks were also the FEDs firemen during the crisis with the Feds forcing JPMC, WF, BoA, and PNC to buy up all of the junk?

Ah_Q,"What a hack job.  Let's go through this real quick.

&gt;On the supply side, the American Bar Association operates a state-approved cartel, which uses a licensing regime to artificially limit the supply of legal services.

Riiiight.  Producing *more JDs* would surely change things.  If there's one thing the legal services market suffers from, it's an *undersupply* of JDs.

&gt;The other big driver of law firm revenues‚Äìwrestling with the increasing amount of and complexity of regulation‚Äìis not going away. Whether it is the Dodd-Frank Act or Obamacare, the regulations coming out of Washington reach deeper into our lives and cover more activities of businesses.

He literally has no evidence to back this up.  None.  If this were true, one would expect certain practice areas to be going bonkers while others remained stagnant.   Really, this assertion is just a vehicle for Mr. Henderson to condemn regulations that, in his view, ""reach deeper into our lives and cover more activities of business.""

And really, did Dodd-Frank or Obamacare single-handedly make the entire body of federal statutory and regulatory law materially more voluminous or complex, as compared to the pre-Dodd-Frank/Obamacare era?  Elsewhere in the article, Henderson asserts that Dodd-Frank ""measured in at about 2,400 pages.""  That's a drop in the bucket, all things considered.

&gt;This vicious cycle means that exponential growth in complexity is baked into the system. It is no wonder that all measures of government size‚Äìwhether it is the budget, the number of pages of federal regulation or the wealth of Washington, D.C. (home to seven of the ten richest counties in America)‚Äìare increasing.

Again, Mr. Henderson produces *zero evidence* that the purported ""exponential growth in complexity"" has led to increased demand for legal services from large law firms.  One cannot merely assume that one precipitates the other.

&gt;For instance, in an April 2015 letter to shareholders, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, announced the hiring in that year of 8,000 new compliance professionals, bringing the banks total to nearly 25,000. The growth is staggering: The bank employed less than 7,000 in compliance roles at start of 2012 and far fewer just a decade or two earlier. Each dollar spent on compliance with law is a dollar not spent making loans or paying employees to do work that adds to economic growth.

First off, one might point out that if J.P. Morgan Chase and other banks had employed *more* compliance professionals before the Great Recession, perhaps some of the abuses and excesses that produced the financial crisis could have been avoided.  In any event, is it really all that unreasonable for J.P. Morgan to devote [1% of its 235,000 employees](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/about-us.htm) to making sure the bank follows the fucking rules? 

Additionally, the assumption that dollars spent on compliance would otherwise be ""spent making loans or paying employees"" is dubious, given that in May 2015 -- about a month after J.P. Morgan's CEO announced the hiring of 8,000 new compliance personnel -- [J.P. Morgan announced that it was laying off  over 5,000 people](http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-expected-to-lay-off-more-than-5-000-by-next-year-1432834029), in large part to ""rely more on technology and less on human tellers.""  (Notably, the layoffs included some in the legal and compliance departments.)

&gt;But compliance professionals and regulators both have incentives to make their rules as complex as possible, since complexity makes their work more interesting and valuable.

Mr. Henderson is obsessed with the notion of ""complexity,"" but keeps making utterly baseless assertions about the supposed consequences of the dreaded ""complexity.""

&gt;Without someone pushing back and demanding that additional regulations and spending on lawyers is worth it, the system can spiral out of control.  The businesses might have this incentive, but few have the courage to stand up to government regulators, who wield enormous power with virtually unlimited discretion.

Wait, so large corporations in the healthcare and finance industries are not ""pushing back"" on additional regulations?  They lack the ""courage to stand up to government regulators""?   Does he forget that these very industries literally spend [hundreds of millions of dollars per year on lobbying](http://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/tracking-lobbyist-spending-so-far-in-2014-1625/)!?

If you have aspirations for front-office kind of work, I don't think the audit-track is right but if you excel in it, you probably won't be in the 60s/70s for long. In my opinion, you should get started where you can and move as soon as you see a better career-fit for yourself. This might mean applying for other jobs now or even talking to whomever mentored you for the internship to get an understanding of whether or not your experience as an intern gives you leverage that can transfer to other parts of the organization.

threeLetterMeyhem,"That sounds a little low for internal audit starting pay, but not crazy low. It might be crazy low in NYC, though.

I have a close friend who works internal audit. His first year out of college he started at a JPMC-like company in Denver in the $70k range with 5% yearly bonus. I believe that's what most of their internal audit people were starting at. After a year or so things went south at that company (layoffs) and he moved on to make a reasonable bit more than that.

If it were me, I might take it if I didn't find anything else and wanted the experience... but I wouldn't spend a lot of time at that pay level in the middle of NYC. I'd be working like crazy for promotions internal or quickly leveraging that experience for something else that pays better.",2016-07-02 05:33:15,d4vw7fp,1,personalfinance
bbrodacious,"5/24 **Exception** Data Point: I was targeted for the United MPE 70k +5k +10k + $50 SC offer and applied yesterday (I know, I'm a procrastinator). At the time of application, I was at 8/24 (including a Chase Hyatt and Marriott card from a little over 3 months ago) so knew it was going to be a long shot.

I received the ""we'll let you know our decision in writing"" message and assumed I was denied (for the first time ever). I called recon later that day and was told very specifically that I could not be approved because I had opened too many credit card accounts in the last two years. I offered to move credit around, close another card, etc. - no dice. I asked to speak to a supervisor, who told me the same thing and basically said there were no exceptions to the rule. Interestingly enough, the two agents I spoke to said they could not disclose whether or not the limit is in fact 5, and they alluded to the fact that the number could change at any time. She also added that: ""We are receiving a lot of feedback about this new rule, and we will be sure to pass along yours as well.""

After my failed recon attempt, I sent a quick email to my JPM Private Banker about the denial and he said he'd look into it for me. I received a phone call just now from a ""senior agent"" in Lending Services who apologized for the ""mix up."" The two people I spoke to the yesterday during my failed recon call weren't aware of my wealth management relationship. After a quick hold, I was approved for a new $25k limit on the card. This is will be my 8th active credit card with JPMC.

So there you have it. If you have a relationship with the J.P. Morgan Private Bank/J.P. Morgan Global Wealth Management, it's possible to circumvent the 5/24 rule. I'm not sure if this exception also applies to Chase Private Clients, but I would imagine so.",2016-07-02 04:18:00,d4vszl8,5,churning

dougie_g,"&gt; I doubt it, these big business have the monetary muscle to jump and change with legislation that smaller companies struggle with.

That's true but completely irrelevant if your business is made commercially unviable or literally impossible. Without passporting, it won't be possible to carry out an entire range of business that is currently done here. And for a great deal of back of house work, it won't make commercial sense any more to have those people based in the UK. 

&gt; There is no reason they will struggle with a Brexit.

They won't really struggle because they will move all sorts of operations to other European countries. JPMC, for instance, is likely looking at 4,000 jobs moving to other EU countries. 

&gt; Anecdotal but my friend who works in financial risk compliance at HSBC says they already have drafted new operations specs and other guidelines to staff on what to expect and how long they will take to implement in the business.

Yes of course compliance have been doing that. It's literally their job to prepare for big upheavals in the regulatory scene. It has literally no bearing on how much Brexit will affect big banks. Compliance aren't responsible for working out the most commercially viable route in light of the impossibility of doing certain kinds of business.

To compare PEY to coop is inappropriate. Engineering students at Waterloo are *required* to find coop placement and in order to support this, their exists the supporting infrastructure. There is no such requirement at U of T.


&gt;""PEY doesn't hold any distinct advantages and anyone who tries to rationalize that PEY is a good alternative is lying to themselves.""

Anyone who blames their lack-of-employability on their University's lack-of-support is [lying to themselves](http://giphy.com/gifs/zNXvBiNNcrjDW). I am currently in New York working at JPMC. Last year I spent my summer in Singapore doing some research at NUS. As a 1T8, I have had no trouble finding work during four months I get for a summer. 


PEY offers more than a coop program can. What is loses from University support it more than makes up for in the experience it offers to a dedicated student. I am looking forward to next year, wherever I may be, when I am on my PEY.

ladysyazwina,"I did mine in Miri and yes, it's cheaper than JPMC. The procedure is pretty simple, you just call up the dental clinic and set up an appointment. Usually this is when you get your x-ray done, make the teeth moulding etc. but it tends to cost extra. SO I suggest if you have a parent/relative working in BSP, you can go to Panaga to do everything for free and just bring them to Miri (this is what I did).

Once you're there, the doctor will assess everything and check if you have any teeth that needs to be pulled out/if you need surgery beforehand. If you do then you'll need to get it done before they can put your braces on (you can do it in Brunei, the doctor will write a letter which you will need to give to the other doctor). I didn't need surgery but I did get some teeth pulled out so the process wasn't too long for me, about a month or so before I actually put them on.

Of course, it's not as convenient as JPMC. I'm super lucky that I haven't broken my brackets after almost 2 years but it really depends on your teeth. If you're prone to breaking them then you'll definitely need to take some time off to go to Miri and get them fixed. Also, making the long drive every month to tighten them can be a turn off for some people (it's not a problem for me because I can go shopping after! xD).

I had three phone interviews. One behavioral, one half and half, one technical.

&gt;What do you like have to know and be good at?

Having a strong resume and being in touch with your campus recruiters helps you land the interviews. As for the interviews, they will give you slides with all the topics you may be asked about. As with most CS interviews: data structures and algorithms, and knowing how to think out loud and explain your thought process.

PM me with any more questions :)

How do you pay something back with interest if the loan has no interest????

They paid them back, because most of the backs that took them did not need them.  The government made over 10% on their TARP loans to JPMC and roughly 20% on their TARP Loans to GS.

Not to mention that QE hurt the banks by bending the long term cost curve and cut their lending spreads...",2016-05-10 07:15:57,d2z89qh,1,politics

So what she did was she went to RIPAS first and their specialist was on break and wouldn't be back after a few months so what she did was she went to JPMC for general consultation and X-ray scan which costs about $100+. They said the same thing to you where it isn't serious but she will feel complications in a later age. In a serious case, they would advise to undergo surgery. She later went to a traditional Chinese chiropractor in Lumut. Unfortunately she doesn't remember what it was called but her appointments cost $30 for the first appointment and $20 for each of the next following appointments. Although she didn't go to RIPAS for a specialist, she said that they won't do much but only give pills unless it was a serious case of scoliosis. She told me to pass on some advice to prevent it from getting worse. 1) Try out swimming and yoga. 2) Try to avoiding lifting heavy weights. 3) Buy a backbrace.

They received 25 Billion in bailout money.  And after 1999, acquired several investment companies, turning them into a FHC.  

Another example in your list is JPMorgan, listed as a bank.  On their own [website](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/jpmorgan-history.htm):

&gt; In 2000, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Incorporated merged with The Chase Manhattan Corp., effectively combining four of the largest and oldest money center banking institutions in New York City (J.P. Morgan, Chase, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover) into one firm under the name of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

Seems you need to research a bit.

&gt; Consumer banks can hold both securities and derivates on mortgages without Glass segal... 

No, that's why they repealed it.

&gt; President Bill Clinton‚Äôs signing statement for the GLBA summarized the established argument for repealing Glass‚ÄìSteagall Section‚Äôs 20 and 32 in stating that this change, and the GLBA‚Äôs amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act, would ‚Äúenhance the stability of our financial services system‚Äù by permitting financial firms to ‚Äúdiversify their product offerings and thus their sources of revenue‚Äù and make financial firms ‚Äúbetter equipped to compete in global financial markets.‚Äù [source is linked at the end of quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall:_Aftermath_of_repeal)

They were using loop holes to circumvent the regulations.  Spinning off third-party companies to handle those aspects of the business since they weren't allowed to.  The repeal just allowed them to do what they had been using loop holes, instead of closing the loop holes.

&gt; Which would have happened without Glass Stegal...

Again, not really.  The people who controlled the credit ratings were now these big banks that had merged.  That's why they were able to approve crap-mortgages.  They needed the money to cover the bad investments from the mortgages they allowed, which they got by offering derivatives on the real estate.  That never sold. Hence, no money to back those investments.  So before they had to pay out, they needed to be bailed out.

Whiteseraph,"Oh my god.  Dude.  I don't even know where to begin with you.

My responses, were directed to your statement.  You need to understand what relevance is.  For instance, if I walk 150 miles a day, and you only walk 10 miles a day.  And someone says, that's a ""long walk"", it's going to mean two different things to both of us.

So, let's try again.  

[YOU SAID](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4gg72t/bernie_or_bust_bernie_sanders_supporters_vow_not/d2i36jz?context=3):

&gt; Almost none of the banks to fail merged in the aftermath of the repeal of Glass-Steagal. Those that did fail were almost all :
A) Solely investment banks.
B) Mid-sized
C) Taking on huge amounts of risk that were unregulated by any legislation, let alone Glass-Steagal. Shadow banking, as Krugman said.

SO, the banks that failed, according to you were A, B, and C.  I refuted A, B, C, saying that those banks failed for reasons similar to mom and pop stores going out of business.  And that the last one was poor business sense.  If a bank fails because it took on huge amounts of risk that were unregulated, then that's poor business sense if they couldn't keep it up.  You're attacking your own statements, more or less, which is amusing, but a waste of time.

Next I say banks and investment companies were allowed to merge.  You say they didn't.
[cough](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/jpmorgan-history.htm) - Before 1999 banks merged with banks, after, banks merged with other companies to make FHC.

[ahem](http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/53) - Scroll down to ""New Rules""

[cough cough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act#Changes_caused_by_the_Act) - Changes caused by the act.

Now, moving on, I said if the companies didn't merge, we wouldn't have needed to bail them out.  You respond with everyone was bailed out, how would this have prevented, blah blah.

According you point A in your statement, Solely investment banks were allowed to fail.  We didn't bail them out.  According to you.  So, it stands to reason, by your own point, that if the banks and investment companies were NOT allowed to merge, and the investment companies took on the risky investments anyways, then they would be allowed to fail.  But because the banks and investment companies merged, if allowed to fail, the FDIC would end up having to pay anyways.  Either way, they would get bailed out because they merged with the banks.

&gt; Yes, they would have. The problem has nothing to do with the type of bank.

The banks would not have made risky investment with the publics money, therefore would not be in the position to be bailed out.  The wouldn't need it, because they wouldn't have lost money on faulty mortgages.  They wouldn't have lost money on faulty mortgages because they weren't allowed to make risky investments with the public's money...  prior to the repeal.  Get it?

&gt; But by signing away Glass-Steagall, we more or less gave permission to allow it to happen.
No, we didn't

If you had bothered reading:
&gt; 1933 ‚Äì The Glass ‚ÄìStiegel Act regulated interest rates, established deposit insurance, and erected a wall between commercial and investment banking by restricting the former from engaging in non-banking activities like securities and insurance.
1978 ‚Äì A successful legal challenge to the state usury laws and the massive promotion of credit cards by the banks led to dramatic growth of credit card debt by consumers.
1979 ‚Äì Pension regulation was loosened which created a new market for speculation and the capital to feed it.
1980 ‚Äì Investors fled conventional interest bearing accounts to alternatives such as money market, venture capital and hedge funds which were lightly regulated.
1982- Congress passed the Garn-St. Germaine Depository Institution Act which deregulated the Savings and Loan industry. This led to speculation with other people‚Äôs money and a crisis which would cost the taxpayer $201 billion. The deregulation of interest rates at conventional banks also led to elimination of bank net-worth, accounting standards, and loan to value ratio requirements.
1999-Republican Phil Gramm successfully led the effort that repealed most of the Glass-Stiegel Act, which was a depression era law that kept Commercial Banking and Investment separated.

Yes, we did.

&gt; Generally I refer to actual economists, not opinion pieces. Like the ones further above that you ignored for no real reason

Oh buddy, you make me smile. = D

This boils down to you not thinking about what it means to be an economist.  Google the definition of economist, then look at the author of the piece.  I've linked enough for you to see he's not the only one writing about it.  Funny, however, that the best defense you got is that it's ""Not directly the reason for the recession"".  Even tho the argument is it paved the way to and allowed it to happen.

You still can't. Look up the OCC's list of permissible bank activities. They're not allowed to deal or underwrite except for some minor exceptions: Type I and II securities. 

That's because Section 16 of GS, which is still in effect, says that a bank cannot do those activities. Section 20 of GS, which was repealed in 1999, simply says that a bank cannot be principally engaged with an institution which deals in and underwrites securities. 

&gt;That's the whole thing we're talking about here, so ""commercial firms"" most certainly means something.

Commercial firms is still meaningless.

The repeal of GS did not directly influence the great recession. All of the actions that led to the 08 crisis were allowed before it. MBS securities have been being created by both Commercial and IB since the 1970s. Commercial Banks have always dealt in mortgage origination. IBs have always dealt in securitization. The combined service banks(both commercial and IB) were the strongest during the crisis(JPMC, WF and BoA). The weakest and the ones to fail were either pure IB or pure Commercial.(Lehman, Bear, WaMu, Wachovia).

Carlswaen,"&gt;Not just high street banks, though - JPMC, BAML, Goldman are all in favour officially of the EU, as, obviously, are Deutsche, BNP, UBS etc.

That kinda leads into the EZ exposure argument that I was talking about though.

Cards on the table, if I were representing the bank or my career interests first I too would be thumping the table, Wolf of Wall Street style (much as they did when they found out the shoe company they'd floated might be selling), although granted with less Hollywood flair, and looking at the 5th largest economy in the world leaving and demanding, ""Don't let the UK taxpayers leave!""

If I were exposed to the Eurozone debt, I'd not want the UK to leave - even if the UK aren't in the EZ.  The UK already bailed out Ireland's banks via the UK bailout, they already increased their contributions on the back of the crisis, and they already increased their float with the IMF (something I actually agreed with).

If there's a restructuring of debt, which many already accept is the case looking at Greece, let alone the third of a trillion Italian debt which some consider already poisoned meat, then  someone outside the national argument might be arguing for more bread in what is already looking like a dogshit-sandwich.

It was only at the end of 2014 that 24 EU banks failed their EBA stress tests.


&gt;Leaving would make European trading more difficult and force them to divide their EMEA operations to a greater extent than they currently do.

I genuinely don't see that in lieu of an FTA, especially since the EU service liberalisation has been slow compared to the other sectors, and that France even argued that there should be UK financial sacrifices in return of reform.

&gt; But you just said you don't know a single person in the City who thinks that way?  

I should have been clearer that I was basing that on the article!

&gt;  If that's correct it's the more gloabal looking hedge funds that tend to favour leaving.  That doesn't make them Wolves of Wall Street.  It's the highstreet banks that are more exposed to EU government bonds that understandably want to keep as many strong economies as possible on an EU deck.

You may well be right. A global hedge fund wouldn't be so bothered about the US specifically, whereas the big institutions will be very widely affected by it. Not just high street banks, though - JPMC, BAML, Goldman are all in favour officially of the EU, as, obviously, are Deutsche, BNP, UBS etc. Leaving would make European trading more difficult and force them to divide their EMEA operations to a greater extent than they currently do.

But it would've stopped Wells, BofA, and JPMC from helping the government salvaging the remains of the marketplace.

IrishMerica,"If bernie wants to further regulate derivatives and credit default swaps then whatever, I'm cool with that. It's the ""breaking up banks"" rhetoric that makes me uncomfortable. The 2008 financial crisis would have happened with or without Glass-Steagall. Only three of the fifteen largest bailouts actually went to banks that would have been affected by Glass-Steagall, so in my mind that either means that Bernie doesn't know what he's talking about or it means that Bernie has a vendetta against Wall Street that doesn't necessarily represent the best interest of the American people.


What makes me uncomfortable though is that Bernie references Goldman Sachs as a bank that he wants to break up which means that he wants to go further than Glass-Steagall. Like it or not, we need high capital banks like GS to handle large scale IPOs and M&amp;A transactions. At a certain point those transactions are just too much for middle market firms to handle. Without banks like GS, JPMC, Merrill Lynch, etc to carry out those large transactions then what will likely happen is that large US companies will have to go to foreign banks like Barclays or Deutsche Bank and at that point that's just money unnecessarily leaving our economy.

DukeMaximum,"The recession was a much different situation than a bank failing. It was a number of issues coming together under poor oversight, and desperate politicians who didn't understand the issues trying to take over, much like a passenger trying to seize the controls from the pilot in the middle of an airplane disaster. It was a failure not just of several financial institutions, but also of the housing industry, which has, for much of the 20th century, underpinned the U.S. economy in some very fundamental ways. The extremely oversimplified cause was that borrowing became very very expensive at a time when may people and companies were relying too much on debt.

The economic impact of a nuclear bomb going off would be almost un-measurably massive. Not only would it destroy real assets, but also debt holders, real estate, and possibly records as well (although this is unlikely.) Lenders would turn to their insurance companies, who would be overwhelmed and would, themselves, have to declare bankruptcy. Billions in assets would disappear, and lending would largely lock-up. So, much like in the recession, the cost of lending would skyrocket, which would cripple most businesses, and anyone who is subject to those businesses' financial health. But the recession, as I stated, was far bigger than a bank failure. In fact, bank failures didn't cause the recession. More accurately, the recession caused bank failures.

A bank failure doesn't actually impact the economy nearly as much as you seem to believe it does. We know this because [banks fail all the time](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/). None have failed so far in 2016, but eight failed in 2015. Did you hear about them? No, of course not. Because it's not that big a deal to anyone who isn't directly associated with the bank. 

Something very simple happens when a bank fails: the bank declares bankruptcy and its assets are purchased by another bank. The bank's lenders get what they can from the sale, and the acquirer gets the bank. Remember when J.P. Morgan Chase bought Bank One? Remember when JPMC bought Washington Mutual? Let's go further back. Do you remember when wild speculation caused [Barings Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barings_Bank) to fail in 1995? It was the second oldest bank in England, having been founded in 1762. It crashed after losing $1.3 billion in poor speculation, and created a scandal in the financial world. Do you even remember that happening? Banks buy banks all the time and, while there are some downsides to consolidation at that level, there are upsides as well. And the downsides aren't nearly what you're imagining.

To answer your questions: I have a very good idea of how much human misery is unleashed when one of those leviathans collapses: not much. How many people lose their jobs? None to some, depending on whether the acquirer wishes to retain them. How many people lose their homes? Absolutely none. At least, none due to the failure of the bank, as the debt is simply purchased by the acquirer. How many people killed themselves in the last recession? Many. But that's irrelevant, since it's a completely different scenario. 

So, please explain, how do *you* think a bank failure would hurt people?",2016-02-18 03:45:52,d03kebj,0,news

""how much they're really worth"" and, ""This is because it would shrink the economy,"" from the article you linked overlooks, in my mind, the scale of the 2007/8 breakdown. I'll come back to this in a sec.

/u/1357anon linked [this](http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfx13fx.pdf) earlier stating NON-retail FX transactions amounted to ~96% of total US FX transactions in 2013 and retail trading amounted to ~3.5%. I say this because Bernie intends to break up the screaming majority of that 96% of monsters altogether and that will have significant impact before transaction adjustments are levied (note $18.125 trillion US GDP 2015). While I obv don't know what Bernie has in mind or if he's even considered retail, any additional inst. regulation will certainly discourage the shrinking number of existing and future available retail brokers, but perhaps not to a serious degree (?). I also get the sense that his tax will roll to HFTs in a majority capacity. Small businesses gotta business, as they say. Anyway, I feel like everything being discussed is commentary- and real talk, I imagine the events over the coming months will affect what's required. Ultimately, it isn't officially *anything* until glass steagall revival is printed in whatever form is required at the time and I think what he's saying on the campaign is related specifically to the biggest bankers. 

Inspired to do some research:

* Lehman had $619 billion in debt [when declaring bankruptcy.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/lehman-brothers-collapse.asp)

* Wachovia's ""loan portfolio"" was valued at [$312 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wachovia#2007.E2.80.932009_financial_crisis)

* Citigroup had [$306 billion in toxic assets](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122747680752551447)

* AIG cost [$182.3 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group#Liquidity_crisis_and_government_bailout)

* WaMu's holdings, including $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, were sold to JPMC for [$1.9 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mutual) so who really knows what happened there

* Merril Lynch had [$118 billion in toxic assets](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/09/the-final-days-of-merrill-lynch/307621/)

And then there was Fannie and Freddie. Forced to mimic similar activity to continue to be appealing in the face of always-shitty government rates and a stupefying, negative reality in the housing industry (talking out of my ass completely), Fannie and Freddie owned or backed about half of the U.S.'s [$12 trillion mortgage market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae) and [$1.6 trillion was debt.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_takeover_of_Fannie_Mae_and_Freddie_Mac)

Putting some of those debt numbers together &gt; and I get something close to $4 trillion that effectively disappeared and would have been almost double if Fannie and Freddie had fully shit the bed. That would have been almost half of the most recent US GDP ($18.125 trillion 2015). Not counting the enormous obligations of Fannie &amp; Freddie, the amount of dollars that vanished is similar to the combined GDPs/GSPs of the bottom 20 states [by order of GSP.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_GDP) Vermont is last on that list. Lehman, Wachovia, Citigroup, AIG, Wamu, &amp; Merril's toxic debt amounted to nearly 100x the most recent GSP for the state of Vermont and RIGHT in between the GDP for California (2015) and Texas (2014). That's also not counting intl losses felt and instability incurred around the world.

Not at all.  All you need to do is look at LBJ for how a President can fuck with the FED.

&gt;That's a record of economic and fiscal policy failure, not success in most Americans eyes.

All of those issues started in the early 70s.  Reagan's policies lessen the hurt of the fall, it did not cause it.

&gt;Not they, he (Clinton).

Damn, I am going to need to call my AP Government Teacher(if he is still alive even) and tell him that he was wrong.  See he taught us that Congress has the power of the purse and writes and passes the budget.  But now you are telling me that the President is some all powerful dictator that has full power of the purse.  Thanks for the information!!!!

&gt; I don't know where you gathered that economic ""gem"", but it reeks of University of Chicago/Friedmanesque lunacy.

Free trade is one of the few things that economists on both the left and the right agree on.  Artificially supported industries are never good in the long run.  They will always create inefficiencies and more long term damage.  Free trade allows for specialization and maximum efficiency.

&gt;Short term dislocations? Over 23 years of U.S. labor market dsamage is LONG-TERM damage, not short-term damage and there's no evidence whatsoever that Free Trade stands any chance of creating decent jobs so give it up. If that misguided economic theory about Free Trade creating decent U.S. jobs stood any chance of working in the U.S., it would have long ago.

23 years is a short term dislocation.  It is barely one generation of workers.  In the long term Free Trade allows the US to focus on areas it can be most efficient(high tech manufacturing, Professional Services, Finance, etc) and less on where it is massively inefficient(labor intensive manufacturing and low skill work).

&gt;That's a blatant lie. Had GS repeal, commodity market deregulation and the loosening of capital requirements not been implemented, the Financial Crisis would have never happened.

The financial crisis most definitely would have happened and it would have been worse.  The main causes were commercial banks doing commercial banking and Investment banks doing investment banking.  The large multi-service mega banks were fine.

It's utter BS since the financial industry only survived after having truckloads of cash dumped into it by the Fed. Who wouldn't survive an economic calamity after someone handed them a blank check?

Except people who work in and understand finance.  We were able to come out of 08 so quickly because we were able to convert GS and MS to Bank Holding Companies and have the successful Mega Banks(JPMC, WF, and BoA) buy up all the trash(after being forced by the FED to do so), a lot of which they wouldn't have been able to buy pre-GS.

&gt;Here's former Citigroup CEO John Reed making that very case and the justifiable reasons for pursuing it. He's right, those who share your viewpoint on the subject are not.

Sorry but if you are going to try the appeal to authority approach you probably shouldn't cite a failed executive of the only mega bank to be so poorly run that they almost failed in 08.  All of the other mega banks were the strongest through the crisis while Citi was so poorly managed their almost failed.  Of course he has that opinion since it covers for his failures...

&gt;That's BS when they could have reined them both in well before 06/07.

It wasn't recognized as being needed any earlier than then.

&gt;There's the real answer to why Fannie/Freddie remained loose cannons until Democrats regained control of Congress.

If that is the case, why did they fight it in 07 when they had control?",2016-01-13 23:22:42,cywo54z,1,politics

They were the Fed's firemen because the Fed was taking all the shitty MBSes off their books and kicking out some $16 Trillion in ~~secret loans~~ liquidity. And a lot of that money went to foreign banks. We weren't just bailing out our banks, but all the big, global players.

Toquen,"There's a lot here and some I agree with and some I don't and some I've opined on in other places. If I were arguing we should pursue all of these policies for all of these reasons, I would have laid this text out differently. I was just trying to unpack the question and provide an explanation as to why you might do this.

In other comments I've mentioned that breaking up the banks might actually be an easier lift politically than reforming the regulatory structure, which could also be greatly beneficial.  As you point out, that model seems to have worked in some places (though not so perfectly in others, like Germany and France).

With regard to BHCs and separate concerns - no that's not correct. For example, broker dealers can be wholly owned subsidiaries of insured depository institutions (banks), not just affiliates under the parent holding company. This is true at several large regionals, Bank of America, and JPMC at least. 

Yes I agree capital is important, but as I've pointed out in other places, when a small number of large banks have concentrated political power it is harder to keep those rules strong over the long term. 

With regard to your market power point - the entire financial sector is not simply emergent, it exists as it formed around a regulatory landscape. We don't know that banks are ""naturally"" this large due to market forces, just those forces that have been created by the regulations we chose to set resulted in some large banks. That could very well be suboptimal. 

SEC has been a terribly inept regulator in many ways. The Fed had all the safety and soundness authority it needed to address this prior to the crisis, why would we vest them with all of the authority when they failed so spectacularly to use it in the past?

Also I agree with some things you said, but agreement is seldom interesting. Cheers.",2016-01-06 07:00:51,cyncqc1,5,politics
Toquen,"Small banks can be well diversified - and many of the large and diversified banks failed to ""shake off"" the 2008 crisis without massive intervention in the markets by the government. 

I agree that we've come a long way in terms of leverage ratios, risk based capital ratios, liquidity rules, etc. However, I don't think we could credibly resolve any of the large bank holding companies under bankruptcy as is required by section 165 - so we still have a ways to go. You'll forgive me if I don't bank solely on the word of credit rating companies, who suffered little for being so hilariously wrong prior to the crisis. There's a lot of politics in those ratings.

They have teams for the very wealthy that combine tax, estate, and investment planning. They will most certainly make money off you, but they are also less likely to screw you because they have fairly strong internal controls and audits and have internal benchmarks to hit as far as investment returns.  It's still a relationship based business, so you need to shop around, and it depends on your location. In the north east and mid west, JPMC, Goldman, and Wells Fargo gave good reputations overall.

Cryptex258,"Price for getting braces at JPMC varies case by case, got mine for $3.5K (wore them for 2 years, had a slight underbite). If I recall correctly, they'd charge $5K max for most cases. First 6 months you're gonna have to pay $300, after that it's $100 per session. Once your braces are off, I THINK it'll only be $50 per session and it'll only be every 6 months. But you'll incur extra charges for x-rays etc. If tooth extraction is required, you're given the option of getting it done at JPMC or government clinic so it's cheaper. Same for cleaning.

I'd suggest consulting both JPMC and in Miri, weigh your options. Personally, I think getting it done locally is more convenient since it's less of a hassle, especially in the case of emergencies.

ladysyazwina,"It really depends on what you're comfortable with. JPMC would undoubtedly be the most convenient place to go to but it's kinda expensive. I have a friend who does her braces there and it cost around $4000 top &amp;amp; bottom. If you have the money, absolutely go for it. I personally go to Miri for my braces and mine was around RM$5000 if i'm not mistaken. I'm not sure about JPMC but I pay RM$120 every time I see my doc. I love my orthodontist so I have no complaints about it whatsoever(added bonus: I also get to go shopping every month!). But of course, distance is a problem for some people. I mean, you have to go there every month.

If you're considering any of these two, I suggest going to a consultation for both so they can give you an estimate on the costs. This will also determine if you need a jaw surgery, in which case they'll refer you to a maxillofacial surgeon which I think will happen before your braces treatment. Lastly, for government braces, you'd have to wait around 4 years before they'll actually call you which kinda broke my heart when I first heard about it. T.T It's cheaper than the previous two but the only downside is the waiting time. :-S

I'm not going to lie, braces are a pain in the ass. People who tell you they don't hurt are liars. But after awhile, you do get used to it. I promise you. It'll only hurt when they tighten it. Also, the whole process can be annoying and slightly daunting. Hygiene is soooooo important. Having braces increases the likeliness of cavities. If you don't take good care of your teeth, you'll end up with white spots on your teeth due to plaque which will be hard to scrape off. During this whole process, it is *crucial* that you see your dentist every few months for cleaning rather than the usual 6 months. Mouth ulcers are also inevitable so just be prepared for that. They'll give you some dental wax for that. Also, thinking of eating something with turmeric in it? Or maybe some delicious curry?

I have a slight underbite and was told that if I wanted to correct it I would need surgery as well (mine is very slight so not doing it). I don't think you can cure a underbite with braces (if the cause is mainly your jaw and not your teeth). They do give you the mouth bands on your braces to stop your jaw from moving outwards (I used them) but in the end it doesn't really do much.

See if you can get a consultation with a dentist first. How bad are your teeth? Mine was bad in two particular areas that showed everytime I opened my mouth so I had to get it fixed.

If you want to be a network engineer take the network engineering job.  It can be hard to change roles within JPMC, even if its a lateral move.

intoOblivion13,"I'm in the CS program so I'll give you some insight (sorry but this might get pretty long). The CE and CS facilities are *NOT* newer facilities so I'm not sure where that came from. The facilities are actually pretty lame compared to other departments in other schools. They are housed separately though from the rest of the engineering school. We are the red-headed stepchild of the engineering school. They want nothing to do with us (except our job and salary reports and our tuition) and we don't really want anything to do with them. Some of the resources offered to other Eng majors simply aren't there for CS/CE/EE (*this part was all my opinion and if you ever visit, I hope you will determine for yourself if you agree or not*)

**Research**: We have some awesome faculty (Kevin Du, Heng Yin, and a few others). That said you'll notice after looking them up that we are heavy in cyber security. If that is what you want to do, then 'Cuse has a *very, very strong* CS/CE program for you. However if that is not what you're looking for we a very much lacking in nearly every other area (except formal methods, which is the primary area of most faculty, but considering you've said CE, I'm assuming you're not interested in that)
*note: we are getting more and more into data mining / AI research - one of the CE professors just did some cool work with neural networks*

**Courses**: As far as classes go, that is definitely my biggest complaint. We just don't offer many other than the core set. Our electives are either all security courses, or just very boring with no real widespread applications.

**Professors**: Some absolutely outstanding professors that really care about your success and some that you will despise. Overall I've been happy with the quality of professors in CS/CE and overall at SU.

Now here is something that I've seen at SU that I think is worth mentioning. 

**Go with Computer Science if...** 
You want to be a software engineer and code a lot. 
Meaning if you want to be a software engineer at Google, FB, etc. then major in CS. CS *in general* will make you a better programmer, and will teach you to solve the problem, no matter what language you're working with. In my personal experience CS produces much better software developers because of this. (Some CS/CE kids compete in programming competitions and CS *again, in general* does much better than the CE kids.)

**Go with Computer Engineering if...** 
You want to work on the hardware side of things.
If you like building with your hands, playing with circuits and networks and all of that kind of stuff then CE will be the program for you. They can blow CS away when it comes to anything involving hardware, be it robotics, or networks, etc.

**Bottom Line**
If you are interested in Computer Security, 'Cuse is seriously an awesome school (I would even say approaching top notch)
While we do have kids that go to Google and Apple (both CS and CE) it is pretty rare. Overall many go to work at JPMC (not a bad thing, but nothing super special either).
Our job placement rate has consistently been 100% (or at least upwards of like 98%, I've never heard of somebody not getting a job unless they were going to grad school)
Also I would say that the department (EE/CS/CE) are *imho* getting better. More of us are getting better jobs, at better places each year, and since SU is such a tight knit community, those people come back and recruit more of us.

I disagree with the statement you made about resources for growth. I had two very good mentors in my internship and as for getting equipment I'd say it's actually too easy. Everyone in my team ordered new Dell slim bezel monitors for development and there is an excess of equipment all over the building. 

I will agree the JPMC does not have as technical culture as strong as tech startups but I would argue that compared to an Enterprise company like IBM it would be very close. As a big bank they pivot and adjust slowly but there are okay tech talks about the newest technologies that JPMC is evaluating for use. 

I was very happy with the work I got on my internship and I think you're being much too harsh saying that JPMC is some sort of career killer/dead end.

Lokomani,"Another former IBMer here. What is your area in IBM?

I can say it overall has been a terrible experience (was originally with a startup that got bought out). 

What makes IBM unique is the incredibly long chain of Managers overseeing everything and the difficulty of getting anything through the bureaucratic red tape. The company has been declining for 12 straight quarters, and the only good areas to be in are so called CAMSS - Cloud, Analytics, Mobile, Security, and Social.  I was in one of these areas, and we refered to it as SCAMS due to the fact that IBMers we met were largely talking heads and the quality of our division went down as we began to bring in longtime IBMers to our department. Big Blue drinks their own kool-aid to the point that the culture has become surreal.

Don't worry about tech questions too much, they are more concerned with applicants that can function in a business, so be ready for STAR questions. 

Their philosophy seems to be that they can teach smart people whatever they need on the job, so they just want to make sure you are somewhat competent. Take this lightly because the company is huge and it could vary based on recruiter. I interviewed my sophomore year and it wasn't a problem. Its a great company to get your foot in the door and hires basically everyone that interns.

Pippen1984,"I really don't think that places like Vancouver or Toronto will see a market correction of 20% and I also don't believe there will be much of a contraction in housing. The issue is a mix of economic change, population growth and physical size. 

In the case of Toronto, it has grown by about 286,000 people between 2011 and 2014 ([here](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo05a-eng.htm)) more than double the Montreal figure. Economically, global cities are the new frontier, and sociologists like Saskia Sassen and Nina Glick Schiller have devoted their life's work to. We're seeing economic activity being concentrated in the Global Alpha cities, like Toronto, which is attracting foreign investment, foreign workers and executives along with intellectual and social capital. So, is this a recipe for low real estate prices? Ask London, San Francisco, New York, Boston.

Toronto is emerging ahead of Chicago and will eventually be North America's #2 urban economy behind NYC. Corporations like JPMC, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are making grander moves into Canada. The TSX (with a market cap of $2,5 trillion) houses 80% of the world's mining companies, is a major commodities and financial exchange. With a number of high profile M&amp;As in the US and the growth of Canadian banking in the U.S., Toronto continues to surpass other US cities in terms of economic might. None of this spells a recipe for reducing real estate prices. 

Then you add the land factor -- they aren't making any more of it. Toronto has blown past 6 million and is chugging along. The Golden Horsehoe is powering towards 9 million. Toronto is projected to create a million jobs over the next two decades. All of these new people need somewhere to go. There's a fixed amount of real estate and limited supply. If Toronto could build public transit infrastructure further, you may get people commuting to TTC or GO stations, but even then, I doubt the effect would be anything but negligible. 

We're moving to a new world order where cities have more impact on national economies than they did before. Take a look at Pearson Airport: It would take you less time to fly from there to Europe than it would some destinations in central Canada. What does that tell you about the nature of global movement? 

If we want Canada to be a global leader in a globalized world, we're going to have to accept that things are going to change. Sleepy, middle-class Toronto is gone. It now boasts more millionaires worth over 30 million than most world cities and has one of the biggest market for vehicles imported/sold worth over $1,000,000. World-class chefs are opening outlets in Toronto and our universities are churning-out MBA grads who are instantly hired by capital markets firms to continue its economic expansion over other cities and corporations. Toronto isn't just ""world class"" but ""world leading"" and with that comes high real estate prices. ",2015-11-12 23:19:18,cwxqc8o,8,CanadaPolitics

funner fact: this breach was directly related to that weakness in their customer identity management system.

funniest fact: they were dinged by auditors on this but the expense to fix it was so great they were granted business justification exemptions several times

funneriest fact: the mitigation they provided to get the exemptions was a weak 2 factor auth implementation which sent auth codes over insecure mediums such as email AND allowed auth codes to be reused

scary fact: this type of neglect towards security is not limited to JPMorgan, but any bank, investment, healthcare, or bitcoin exchange could have ridiculous security policies behind the scene.  for instance, how many times have you gone to see a bankster, talked them up to get something from a 'back room' and said bankster leaves his or her computer fully unlocked.  or said banksters or bitcoin exchange (OKCoin comes to mind) have open power receptacles or network ports/cables sitting in plain sight allowing social engineering or other clandestine penetration attempts?

please do not look at this post with the mentally of 'HERR THIS IS WHY BITCOIN IS BETTER THAN BANKS', please look at it as companies as a whole need to better their security policies and massive penalties (% of your income, criminal penalties?) need to be put in place for those who cannot manage their own security.  if we do not do this then the flipside is a TSA for network security.  we do not want TSA for network security.  trust me.

I'd try going to jpmc maybe if you don't have resources to go abroad. I personally can't because I'm paranoid people will know me if I go there for therapy.


I think I spoke of these in previous random discussion thread and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/3ham30/need_help_with_university_research/) , I never disclose my mental illness especially for employment unless it's really affecting my work. It's not like there's disability benefits program here anyways; so all you'd be getting by telling people about it are unemployment and social exclusion bc people think you be crazy. By law (at least within the western part of the world), psychotherapists are not allowed to tell anyone about your mental illness unless you are in danger of harming yourself or others. In the EU, the records are kept for 10 years max where if you ever get in trouble or sth, there's record of your illness. 


So my advice would be to never tell anyone except for the people you truly trust. People who are close to you and would care about you. Especially in bipolar where the closest people will be able to tell your difference in mood. 


About the religious thing, don't go too much into it. Because the more you connect mental illness and piousness, the more people will associate it that way. I try to sway people from thinking it stems from religion. Personally, I think spirituality might help people stay calm. But that doesn't necessarily mean praying. Meditate, go for walks, breathing techniques are what I tend to do to stay in control of my life. However, in the initial stages, therapy was the most important thing to me.

popfreq,"&gt;  Reich is correct. Over 4000 banks failed at the start of the Great Depression, and while there have been individual bank failures since then, there were no financial panics when Glass Steagall was in force.

Over 1000+ S&amp;L trusts that failed.

&gt; G-S did not apply to S&amp;Ls, and that was one reason for the S&amp;L crisis, actually, because S&amp;Ls were doing highly risky investments and speculation in an environment of deregulation. So pointing to the S&amp;L crisis hardly helps your case.

S&amp;L's took risky investments because they were already broke. The crisis was caused by the high inflation of the 70s and the 80s. The investments made things worse, but were mainly a device to kick the failures down the road. 

&gt; Because of the repeal of G-S, the large commercial banks like Citi and JPMorgan were able to buy, sell and underwrite high risk complex MBSs, CDOs,

Forget that Lehman, Bear Sterns, AIG -- none of them commercial banks -- were at the heart of the crisis and that the majority of Mortgage Backed Securities were bought by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. JPMC was not that badly off, but it was affected, and yes Citi was in huge trouble because of mortgage backed securities.  However...

**Glass Steagall did not prevent banks from dealing with mortgage backed securities, CDOs, etc** -- Citi in particular had been dealing with Mortgage backed securities since the 80s.

Not at all.  Glass-Steagall would not have prevented anything, and in fact the repeal of Glass-Steagall helped to soften the blow of the crisis.

MBS have been around since the 1970s.  Most of the banks that had issues were pure investment banks, not ""commercial banks gambling with depositor money"".  The ability for those commercial banks to buy bad investment banks helped to bring us out of the crisis.(JPMC buying Bear, BoA buying Merrill, GS and MS becoming ""Bank Holding Companies"".)

AceOfSpades70,"&gt; Uh...3 of the top 5 banks in the world by market cap are US banks, and they just so happen to be the banks that gave a shit ton of money to Obama in 2008.

No one uses market cap when discussing bank size.  They use assets.  You only have 1 US bank in the top 10 and only 4 in the top 20.

&gt;I'm sure that's a coincidence though.  Or as you call it the ""Natural result of efficiencies.""

It is.  Most of them were that size before Obama took office.  Also, as I said, more of them are that size because of being used as the FEDs fireman in 08.  ML became BAML, Bear, WAMU and other got taken over by JPMC, Wells took over Wachovia.

CLons,"I can chime in here, I was a dev at JPMC - IB (Investment Banking) for a while.  A lot of these other reviews are fairly spot on.  The culture is serious and steady; the whole dev floor was library quiet.  Dress code was business casual, very very conservative culture.  Like any firm that size there are some politicians, however for the most part you simply need to be only vaguely aware of them, since they don't affect you on a day to day.  As with any large team as well, you will quickly realize some people are there to do the work and some people are just along for the ride.

Project wise however, the time lines are aggressive.  Managers, and especially new managers want to make names and climb the ladder, so they commit classic blunders of over promising and under delivering.  This results in some long nights/weekends come end of quarter and a lot of stress come deadlines or quarter close.

On the benefits side life is good.  An internal email nets you some perks:  Free, no charge ever, premier checking + savings accounts (10k Min balance waived).  Employee rates for auto loans + refinancing (You credit tier + 1 generally).  Some standard rate type stuff (Discount for Verizon / AT&amp;T phone plans (28% for me!) , slight discounts for car rentals, hotels, etc.).

Work and pay-wise: they are not shy about asking you to work overtime, sometimes upwards of 60-80 hours a week (Read: Quarter Close again), however on the flip side, they are not shy about paying out for it if you are one of the lucky ones that negotiated overtime into your contract (You might not be able to at entry level).  Salary was fairly decent, vets made reasonably competitive salary + benefits.

At a technical level, a lot of the work as you can imagine is DB / Automation scripting/ Java / Oracle/ TM1/ Some Batch.  Corp utilizes an EP model (Enterprise Planning) that waterfalls down into the branches, who take their sections and load them on a monthly BD (Business Day) Cycle.

According to you.  Based on most of the numbers it appears closer to 2 cookies for stealing one.  The only people who think otherwise are the nut jobs that think the entire MBS market was based on fraud when there is zero evidence to that effect.

&gt;Is it productive? 

They seemed to be.  You were able to get stable returns at a fairly low risk.

&gt;Does it actually make anything? 

Why does it need to make anything?  You could also argue that the MBSs incentivized the building of houses, which is making something.

&gt;Are they the best at it? 

Why do they need to be the best?

&gt;How big is the market for what they make?

The market for MBS was trillions of dollars.

&gt;Such bearism, bask in it.

That wasn't your argument at all.  It was more so that you thought the risk premium was too low.  For every one times a bear is right screaming about too low risk premiums, there are ten times the bull beats him.



&gt;State and how much they paid for it, thats it. No paystubs to see if there would be a revenue stream, nor appraisals to see whether the house was in good condition or just had some paint and spackle thrown around to cover shit up.

Appraisals were done most of the time.  You didn't need to know they could pay it back, just needed to assume that the houses price would go up.

http://www.businessinsider.com/youre-all-wrong-blame-the-appraisers-for-the-mortgage-crisis-2010-4

&gt;How can you say the borrower made a sound decision when they took out and spent 400k on a house that was only selling for 200k two years ago. It didn't double in value, they got fleeced. The bank gave them a loan for an asset they couldn't afford, priced at a point that made it not worth buying because they had a mechanism to relieve themselves of all responsibility for that shit investment

Who are you to say it is a bad investment?  Often times those homes went up even further and made the person money when they resold(also the percentage of homes doubling in 2 years was so tiny to ask why even bring it up as a discussion point?)  However, you are incorrect in saying it didn't double in value.  It most clearly did, because it sold for that much.  Not its' value may have dropped a couple of weeks  or months later, but the value may have increased as well.

&gt;The assumption was that because the average price went up, it meant that on average, the worthiness of all houses was improving, this premise is false on its face.

Have you read anything I wrote?  Have you done any research into MBS?  The whole basis for the market was that the securities were fine as long as housing prices did not drop across the country.  It is not false on its face since it has only happened once in US history.

&gt;The worth of the houses were falling due to the effects of entropy and the overall trend of increasing price only came from new, expensive houses entering the market, fighting against the tide of persistent maintenance expenditures.

Except they were not.  Older houses were going up in value.  Go look at home prices and values on Zillow.  See what older homes were bought for in the late 90s up through the late 2000s.  What you will see is a bunch of older homes going up in value.

&gt;Highly politicized issue, you're going to have to spell out what you're hinting at.

I am not hinting at anything.  I have spelled it out in plain English multiple times.  The only time in US history that housing prices across the country fell was during the Great Depression.

&gt;Nope.

Thought so.

&gt;No, they wouldn't, these things were failing on their own accord while housing prices were still going up.

Except they were not.  You see a direct correlation in the failure of these securities and the downturn in housing prices.

&gt;garbage loans were produced by the private market, rated by the private market to be sold to the private market; 

Don't forget encouraged/incentized/forced by the government as well.  The 08 crisis is a shining example of the government causing issues and then blaming the market.

&gt;What does that even mean?

I'll make this simple.  Firemen put out fires.  When something is on fire you call the firemen to put it out.  Bear, Merrill etc etc were on fire.  The government called their firemen (JPMC, BoA, etc) to come put out the fires.

&gt;You can't, and that feeling in the pit of your stomach is cognitive dissonance, been there.

&gt;This is a very specific claim, not substantiating it is a retraction.

Dear god man.  For someone who claims to be so well informed of the crisis I would never have thought this was needing a source.  It it a foundational issue with the crisis.  Do I need to source Bear Stearns failing?  However, to help you out I will cite it for you.

Hopefully documents directly from Treasury Secretary Paulson are a good enough source.

&gt; it was, IS, a crisis of confidence.

A big reason for the crisis was the government stepping in to bailout one bank, then not bailing out the next.  Banks thought they were safe going into the 08 summer, and increased their risk appetite.  If bear had been let to fail, the banks would have corrected course and decreased risk.

&gt; The market rewarded making loans backed by an appreciating asset. Not making the shittiest loans possible.

No documentation. Just because there is an expensive new house on the other side of town does not mean that a house magically gets newer. Do you not understand statistics at all?

How can you say the borrower made a sound decision when they took out and spent 400k on a house that was only selling for 200k two years ago. It didn't double in value, they got fleeced. The bank gave them a loan for an asset they couldn't afford, priced at a point that made it not worth buying because they had a mechanism to relieve themselves of all responsibility for that shit investment. Thats the role of banks in society, we deposit our money, they find responsible ways to put it to work, if they arn't going to do their job, why do we even need them?

&gt; For your analogy the gold was shit. So the asset backing the loan was shit. In reality the owner was shit, but the asset was fine.

It works and you have no rebuttal. Investors couldn't gauge the worth of the cdo's because the credit rating agencies were lying about the nature of the investment, in the same way that a crooked pawn shop might take a kickback from the guy selling lead bars with gold spray paint when rubes wander in asking for their ""gold bars"" to be appraised.

No, they wouldn't, these things were failing on their own accord while housing prices were still going up. These were not composed of a healthy cross section of the market, they were scraped from the bottom of the barrel.

&gt; Have you done any research on the 08 crisis?

Yes, I graduated into a dead market and had ample time to stew on it.

Mediares PPE is a part of their cost of care reimbursement though.  

I'll try to explain this again for you.  For a VA run hospital, they get a reimbursement from the government for the cost of care and separate ones for things like PPE and administration.  Medicare only pays hospitals one fee for everything(again why understanding DRGs and CPTs are important.)  If VA patients went to non-VA hospitals, their direct cost of care goes up, but they lose their PPE, Administration etc etc expense.  Saving billions.

&gt;No, setting people on fire is most certainly a crime.

Not during war.  Thats like saying shooting someone is a crime.  Shooting someone during a war is not a crime.

&gt;Lying about the nature of an investment is fraud. Specifically setting out to make crap loans that are certain to blow up that you only make because you can lie about them in order to sell them is damn well criminal.

And where it happened charges were filed and the fines paid...

&gt;It stunk like shit when I first heard about it. Housing prices are going up, so you think its time to buy a house? ""Buy high, sell higher""? No that doesn't sound right...

That what bears always say.  Bears always think everything is shit.  They are right once every 10 years or so and miss out on most of the money

&gt;Loans fail all the time, even if reality matched your sense of entitlement (which it doesn't, individual houses rot away and get condemned), you still arn't taking an unbiased distribution, the state of the market rewarded banks for making the shittiest loans possible, things that were guaranteed to fail.

The houses rotting away and being condemded were part of the equation for backing the assets.  Houses last a long time.  Especially new houses.  Especially expensive new houses.  The market rewarded making loans backed by an appreciating asset.  Not making the shittiest loans possible.

&gt;No, you're still trying to compare the house to gold, I'm talking about the collateralized debt on millions of houses as an asset you are unable to appraise for yourself vs the gold bar being an asset you are unable to appraise yourself. Eureka!

For your analogy the gold was shit.  So the asset backing the loan was shit.  In reality the owner was shit, but the asset was fine.

&gt;This is a completely different thing, so different I can only guess where you think the overlap is.

Not at all.  The assumption was that housing prices across the countries were uncorrelated.  This was true for all of US history except for the Great Depression.  It was assumed the factors that caused the Great Depression had been fixed, thus the outlier could be ignored.

&gt;Yes, thats the assertion, the faulty, destructive assertion that ruined the world economy. Instead of it being a healthy cross section of the housing market, it was garbage that wouldn't have existed had this brainfart not enabled its creation.

Honest question.  Have you ever taken a finance class or worked in the industry?  Correlation was the issue here.  If housing prices across the country had not all decreased at the same time, the MBS would have been fine as they were.

If they had just let Bear fail, the majority of the crisis would have been averted.  Goldman, JPMC, BoA MS, etc did not need the money.  They were forced to take it.  There is a reason TARP made the government so much money, despite the massive losses on GM.

Where are they largely cited?  I have yet to see anything that shows they bear any real blame, let alone being the main reason.  Allowing IBs and Commercial Banks to merge played no role in the Crisis.  The main players in MBS(something that have been around since the 70s) were IBs with no commercial banks.

In fact the argument could be made that GLB helped lesson the impact of the financial crisis(through allowing JPMC, BoA, Barclay, Wells, etc) be the Fed fireman through buying up all the shit.  Of the 4 big banks, only 1 was in real trouble(Citi).",2015-07-29 05:21:21,ctjhc7t,0,politics
AzmanRahman1234,"I honestly think if your trying to get fit, going hardcore and getting a gym membership and stuff is probably not the right thing to do. Yeah you get pumped and stuff but the membership isnt enough to keep you in the door it is determination that keeps you in. If you aren't motivated enough to get fit without equipment then its just going to be a waste of money.

I think if you want to get fit you gotta pick something you like to do and JUST DO IT &gt;:D If you like a job then working doesnt feel as boring or demotivating.

I recommend you: Go on youtube, pick a sport that you like (dont go for something retarded like parasailing) or a physical activity that you find interesting and would like to do eg:-

-Biking (fun as fuk, just dont fk up and it is so good at burning calories)
-Swimming (If you dont have access to a pool then this can be tricky. I only recommend this if you are like me who has a parent with a gym membership. Jpmc is good but empire is better for this coz the pool is indoor so you are unaffected by the rain but then again Jpmc has a hot tub)
-Skateboarding (Most people have one of these anyway but if you dont, you can get one from giant for 18 bucks. You dont need the most expensive board if your new since you would be putting down a lot of money for something you might not use) This is fun as fk since there are soooo many tricks to learn and even as a beginner with a shitty board, if you live next to a steep hill skating down and just feeling the wind is pretty awesome
-If your feeling extra malay get a football and just kick it around outside pretending your messi and try to learn some tricks.

Once you've found the sport you like, go to the mall and get a dumbbell set from the bottom floor (pretty expensive but much more motivating then a gym membership). Go home and play around with the weights to try and figure out how much you can do 7 reps of. What i mean is like keep changing the combinations of the weights you put on and try to do a bicep curl (google it). If you can do 7 easily you are using too little weight. You need to only be able to do 7 reps with the last 3 being very difficult before you need to rest.

Every day lift that shit b4 going to sleep. It seems hard to comprehend, but when your actually doing it, you feel so fking fit and good that you actually WANT to keep going. This is like a self motivator and like until today, i have never felt it as being a pain to do.

TL;DR: find a sport you like, buy dumbells, go on sixpackshortcuts youtube channel and JUST DO IT MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.

ben1204,"&gt;Congrats on finding issues with a couple billion dollars worth of securties in a trillion dollar market. Small potatoes like I said.

You seem to ignore the article I linked to regarding JP Morgan's CD's. I would not remotely call that ""small potatoes"". And what I said with Mozilo was that his *punishment* was $20 million, which I argue was insufficient.

&gt;It would have changed nothing in the run up.

To be fair, there were loosening of restrictions on Glass Steagall that hurt along with the actual repeal, like those announced by the fed in the 1980s, but this isn't true.

&gt;Because it wouldn't have changes anything.

Which is simply not true

&gt;They could not. The biggest issue was created by two of the investment banks, Lehman and Merrill, and their actions would not have changed in the run up. The reason GLB helped soften the blow is it allowed the IB to change to bank holding companies and be able to access the discount window. It also allowed Commerical Banks to buy the failing IBs to stop the crisis. It allowed JPMC to be the government's fireman and put out fire after fire during the crisis. It allowed Barclays to buy the last bit of value from Lehman, it allowed BoA to buy Merrill. Without GLB none of this could have happened and the crisis would have been orders of magnitude worse.

I've never heard anyone claim that allowing commercial banks to purchase the IB's helped to stop the crisis. That's a rather bizarre assertion. First of all, so what if the IB's failed? I would argue that it wouldn't have had really far reaching consequences for most consumers. Bundling up these banks have really made things worse in the long run, actually.

I'd argue anyways that we should have let the banks fail regardless. That's not a fringe view, many conservatives actually agree with it too. Would have been the better long term solution.

&gt;Stiglitz is a partisan hack with an agenda to push. Your Goldmans, Merrills, Lehman, Bears and such would have all been the same size. The 08 crisis was not a commercial banking crisis, but a shadow banking crisis.

It would have changed nothing in the run up.

&gt;Would it have singlehandedly prevented the financial crisis? I haven't heard anyone say that.

Because it wouldn't have changes anything.

&gt;It's weird to say GLB helped to soften the blow. It created an environment in which the US Government felt more forced to bail out the banks. If the separation still had been present, the government could have let the investment banks fail with fewer consequences. 

They could not.  The biggest issue was created by two of the investment banks, Lehman and Merrill, and their actions would not have changed in the run up.  The reason GLB helped soften the blow is it allowed the IB to change to bank holding companies and be able to access the discount window.

It allowed Barclays to buy the last bit of value from Lehman, it allowed BoA to buy Merrill.  Without GLB none of this could have happened and the crisis would have been orders of magnitude worse.

&gt;It also made banks more complex, inflating the credit bubble even further. Stiglitz has argued it created even bigger banks, exacerbating the too big to fail problem.

There were many others that were in the same situation... including GS and MS, though Lehman was probably the biggest in that market. 

Lehman would probably have survived had there not been a ""run on the bank"" scenario where it was a death spiral with people concerned that you're in trouble so they make margin calls or ask for more collateral, which in turn gets you more in trouble. 

What they did do wrong was Dick Fuld assumed that the Fed/Treasury would not let them go down and given them emergency funding to support them. However, Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, formerly CEO of GS hated Fuld and wanted to make an example out of someone. LEH was that fateful one. 

What LEH did do wrong was when the markets rallied after Bear Stearns was bought by JPMC, they should have trimmed their portfolio, but they miscalculated the situation and it all came back down crashing. Where they were also at fault was Fuld didn't take the offer from Warren Buffett and a whole bunch of people including Barclays walked away from the deal because Fuld was asking for guarantees for the firm etc, which he wasnt in a position to do.

No, it's just true. I'm not seeking to excuse incompetence, of which there is plenty in the IT security world, at all levels. My entirely true and relevant point is just that defense is more challenging and demanding. As an attacker, you can sit around for months scanning and fuzzing and injecting, and eventually capture the flag through luck and determination. Luck and determination do *not* cut it on 'D', defenders need a whole different approach, a whole different culture. You have to have architects, not just demolition crews.

&gt;'Governments' are fragmented and basically shit organisations with no real responsibility to their stock holders.

I don't entirely agree or disagree with that. Governments *can be* very effective. Parts of our government *are* very effective. But other parts are not. And Uncle Sam is not just any government. It possesses some pretty unique characteristics and challenges.

&gt;Try to get into JPMC or any other private financial and you'll see the difference in their surface vulnerability.

Big banks, in particular, do an admirable job. But they typically do it with a lot of help and subsidies from their governments. Because they're situated atop so much densely packed capital and influence, it becomes difficult for adversaries to overwhelm them, they're ideal defenders: loaded for bear, scope-limited, and heavily autonomous. 

Our government suffers because it is so huge and ""siloed"". Give JPMC as much to do as Uncle Sam has and you'd see similar results. Give Uncle Sam the flexibility (and, to be fair, the pervasive desire) to holistically and generously shore up its defenses, and it would not to that poorly.

kapuasuite,"The market (meaning the stock market) crashed in 1929 and continued to decline, although in less dramatic fashion, into the 1930's. The Banking Act of 1933 (it was actually the second one, Congress wasn't into fancy acronyms like USA PATRIOT Act at that point) included the provisions that came to be known as Glass-Steagall. Among other things (like prohibiting paying interest on checking accounts) it separated traditional banking and securities firms in order to prevent precisely the type of moral hazard you're describing. 

But here's the thing: most of the banks that were being wiped out during the 30's were precisely the type of vanilla, ""boring"" community ones that people today associate with safety. As it turns out, small banks whose loans are concentrated in one area can fail pretty easily if, for example, the local plant closes and nobody can afford to pay their mortgage. They weren't collapsing because of ludicrous bets on complex derivatives, they were simply doing what they had always done: take deposits and extend loans. Saying that the banks were ""gambling"" with people's savings is true in a literal sense, but only because prior to the advent of deposit insurance *any* form of banking was a gamble. 

To jump back to modern days, attempting to link the repeal of Glass-Steagall with the crisis in 07/08 is a popular, although I think misguided, pastime. Glass-Steagall didn't just disappear overnight, it was slowly whittled down through decades of legislative tweaking and experience. So attempting to to say it went away and then suddenly the crisis happened is intellectually dishonest, to say the least. But even then, isn't that what we expect in a democracy, for legislators to look at decades-old laws and say ""hey, this isn't working lets do something different, or this is unnecessary and doesn't accomplish its stated goals?"" I think so. Glass-Steagall was repealed because the lines between commercial and investment banking had been blurring for decades, and we hadn't had any problems on the scale of the 1930's or even close to it.

In concrete terms, you'll find that it wasn't the combination commercial-investment banks that collapsed in 2007 and 2008, it was banks like Lehman and Bear that stuck to investment banking. It was AIG, an insurance company. It wasn't JPMC writing crap mortgages, it was originators like Countrywide and banks like WaMu. Do we really need Do we really need fewer JP Morgans and more Lehmans? That's the inescapable fact that is seldom repeated but quietly acknowledged even by people like Elizabeth Warren: Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the housing bubble, and it would not have prevented the financial crisis that ensued. The only reason its reinstatement has ever even been discussed is because it makes a great focal point for people's anger over moral hazard and is the quintessential ""simple solution to a complex problem."" It's much easier to create a narrative of evil, greedy bankers, innocent customers and toothless regulators when you can point to one single event and say ""this was repealed and it caused the crisis.""",2015-06-11 20:01:57,cs2x971,2,worldnews

what-the-hack,"&gt;Lets say we have a 0-day exploit for a specific application. It runs completely in memory when executed, with full user level rights. Assuming your endpoint protection doesn't detect it and block it, then your initial lines of defenses have failed. 

Sure. 

&gt;So, what is the most common thing you see malicious code do to maintain persistence? Its usually to create some file buried in the Appdata, set to execute when the user logs in.

Ok... but what if its in your hive.sys? Or adds an AT task that runs as system? Or is in your svhost? Or task sched as local system? You are talking about kiddie scripts persisting in appdata ok so you made your GPO as follows, stop .exe's from running in /*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*.exe (formatting does show stars :() you know your malware can read the string and simply find a folder to run it? SRPs are very weak, I'd rather focus on not getting the malware in the first place. Macro enabled word dropped on us? Well fuck you user, disable macro's via GPO, publish word on citrix in an isolated environment. Need to run java 6.25 because JPMC doesnt like to patch their portal? Airgap it. Thats the reality that we live in. 

I'd probably be ok with SRPs if I trusted them / they were easier to manage (or had a freaking password prompt to run there are products that do this btw, we've tested them). I just dont see the benefit / complexity when isolation or removal of the vector simply guarantee that this wont ever be an issue. And you are right, there are times when it makes sense, mid-size businesses, places that allow you to plug shit into a PC, VPN (christ i'd still put up a RDS in this case and only allow them access on 3389 but to each his own), but as a security layer its a weak one.

There's several banks involved here, so the impact on the economy would end up being several times more severe, too.

Taking one of these banks for an example:  JPMC employs a quarter of a million people, and holds $2.6 *trillion* in assets (The 2006 U.S. Federal Budget being around 2.7 trillion, for comparison).  The company has over 3 billion shares outstanding.  That means there's a lot of people are depending on JPMC for their livelihoods:  Their employees, their investors, and their customers... and the investors aren't just a bunch of billionaires.

pt4117,"&gt; I meant that they're more secure than digital locks...you know, the thing we were talking about?

Well first of all they are both locks... So I'm sure you can see the confusion when you say a lock is better than anything else.  

Banks have attempted hacks all of the time, but they aren't breached often.  
http://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2015/01/13/the-big-data-breaches-of-2014/
Look through that list.  How many banks do you see?  JPMC got dinged, but that was one bank, once and not the money or truly valuable information.  So where do you get that banks get hacked all of the time?  

It's not a gadget for the sake of adding a gadget?  Have you really looked into this tech?  I have, and Z Wave devices are all of the place and do more than just add an automatic lock.  I know someone that gets alerted when his door is opened, or when his child gets home.  He has it set so that he can unlock it remotely or allow certain people only access during specified times.  If they can't remember if they locked the door they can do it from bed.  They can even schedule the dead bolt to lock every day at a certain time.  The pictured item kind of looks comically childish, but the big lock makers (kwikset schlage) have devices that use this tech.  


&gt;Finally, you don't have to sit outside a house with a laptop. Have your friend do it from their car.

So you don't have to look sketchy, let your friend look sketchy.  How is that different?  

Do you really think the fact that i bought a lock picking set on amazon 5 years ago puts me on a list that the local police would ever see?  Do you know how many crimes have been commited with a lock picking set?  I don't either, but it's a lot, and do you know how many times i've been questioned about any one of those, since I do own a pick set?  Yeah, it's never happened.

joebronco,"This feedback is fantastic, thanks very much for continuing the discussion. Some thoughts in response to this:

1) ""Just paying the minimum of attention"" For many consumers, this may not be as simple, convenient, or easy as you make it sound here. As you correctly stated, consumers have fragmented bank accounts. Right now there is no mobile app that will let you view AND transfer funds across those accounts. As a result, to do the task you mentioned, a consumer accesses multiple bank apps, many of which log you out once you switch to another app. The task of logging in to these apps is already a pain point that prevents users from interacting with them. (capital one is trying very hard to tackle this with a number of initiatives to simplify the login functionality).
&gt;&gt;Second, the ability to view which accounts are at risk of an overdraft is very difficult for the average consumer to gauge as their spending can [feel] relatively sporadic. Many consumers (though everyone agrees you need to spend time making a budget) stink at actually structuring and maintaining a budget. This invites the notion of third party applications that are just for budgeting, but now you're talking about engaging with a new app. 
&gt;&gt;Lastly, consumers are lazy. Simple as that. If i have all the accounts at one bank, it's still annoying for me to do anything manually, and usually, the minimum amount will not suffice in the long-term. What you're talking about is also a daily check in, and while it is maybe only 5 minutes a day, it's about a half hour a week, and 26 hours a year of my day that i'd rather spend doing other things. (not to mention the majority of people are not finance savvy).

2) ""spend several hours simplifying...""  &gt;&gt; to this point i raise the same issues. Several hours simplifying something is worse for users than leaving it be, and not sending several hours doing anything I don't want to. It's hard to get consumers to do anything they aren't being paid for, even if they are losing money. Also, many of the other posts are actually against consolidating accounts in the same bank because their various other banks offer better account structures, have more branches near them, or have other conditions attached (like CC plans that require a hosted checking account in that bank, for example). Consumers have fragmented accounts for these, among many other reasons. And the idea that it will make it easier for them to do a single function isn't rewarding enough for them to go through that effort, and potentially give up the other benefits associated with these separate accounts. My thought is, let the consumer keep their money where they currently have it, but be able to spend from those accounts as they wish. The transfers take place behind the scenes, and they don't have to pay attention &lt;at all&gt;
3) Calling the bank is also annoying for consumers. This is also why banks are making their own mobile app pushes. BOA offers overdraft protection, but this is max 3x per month, and they charge $10 for every time they initiate such a transfer. Additionally, you need to have the attached savings account/other account with BOA, who also have other restrictions on savings accounts. 

4) ""actually have your personal finances in order"" &gt;&gt; you're definitely pounding this point home again and again ;) For people like you and I, and like most others on this thread, we're more savvy than the average consumer with things like bank account structuring, offerings, and a general know-how of account management. But for Joe plumber or Fred the taxi driver, they may not know about bank offerings, let alone how to get what they really need from the banking space. It's great that you enjoy managing your money, but for most people, it's something they'd rather wish was just ok, without them having to do it. It's a chore. 

5) Not sure I need to respond to this one. it's not really solving any problem ;) 

We're currently in an accelerator program at citibank, and I can tell you that banks are not working on anything like account consolidation. Also, the way that banks make fees, especially after the Dodd-Frank rulings, are intentionally confusing and difficult to navigate. The problem is so severe that a new government institution was established just to protect consumer finances. Banks are not trying to be part of the solution, because now their main source of revenue comes from these fees. (45% of gross bank revenues, for JPMC, the biggest bank, it's actually +70%)

Everyone is hands on in some fashion and they don't have a typical hierarchy of titles (not like a JPMC that hands out VP titles like candy).  If you care about title and upward mobility, you may not find this environment ideal for that.

However, you will likely make a ton of money with these companies.  Most offer excellent bases and ridiculous bonus packages (some will be 100% of base sometimes).  Some of the HFT firms have been known to pay developers $300K-$400K or more all in, but they are usually 8-10 year developers.

Yes, the Federal Reserve has a legal monopoly because it acts, ostensibly, in the interest of the nation rather than for profit. Manipulating interest rates helps the Fed influence inflation, bond markets, and liquidity. GS, JPM, etc. are not subsidiary banks, those are for-profit entities. 

&gt;Your local bank isn't competitive with Goldman or JP Morgan, guaranfuckingteed. 

That doesn't mean either entity has a monopoly. Some companies are larger than others, that's basically all you are saying. So what?

tboonpickens,"*Your rights when critical data is stolen; demand fair compensation*

I'll state my bias, since that's appropriate in this case.  I am an information security professional.  However, I am also a person very interested in consumer issues and consumer rights.   I always have been.

You have rights as a customer of organizations which failed basic security in their infrastructure.  Basic prevention techniques could have made exploitation much more difficult.  Do you think 1 year of credit monitoring will fully protect you?  The answer it is not even remotely close to even the basic protection required.   Identify theft may be the least of their worries.  In some of these cases there are bank account numbers floating around.

This is getting to be a major confidence issue on the banking system.

At a minimum, I feel lifetime credit protection should be mandated, and the ability to pay for lifetime credit locks.  That is the absolute most basic thing they should pay.  What would that cost?  Well, to lock credit reports is $5 or more for each one (at this time).  In addition, if you want a loan or needed a credit check, you have to pay for unlocks.  Is it your fault you need that unlock?  Demand an adequate amount of money to pay for lifetime credit locks and unlocks and credit monitoring.  Even with credit locks, the credit is opened for a window of time where others could exploit it.  This is serious and corporations shouldn't be trying to weasel their way out of their liability by offering one year of credit monitoring.

The American people need the security community to tell them the best way forward, and not out of greed.  What *I* see are root causes of basic configuration errors on endpoints, such as missing patches, or lack of two factor authentication.  I hear a lot about 'sophisticated attacks' in the news, but when you search for 'root cause' on the internet, it's time and time again it seems to be one simple misconfiguration.

jason_bateman78,"Let me preface this with the fact that I have actually worked for one of the top investment banks ( some may say _the top_ investment bank ;) ) and, unlike you, I am very familiar with the requirements around processes and procedures.

&gt; Are those regulators auditing every line of code written by employees too? 

It is a regulatory requirement that any production software or data changes are logged and available to auditors. This means that any version deployed in production is linked to a specific non-modifiable tag/branch, as well as an audit trail of who performed the change, who did the code review, what testing was done, which managers signed off on the change, when was the change released to production and who performed the post-production tests. So, if at any point a regulator requests why trading system X malfunctioned and flooded the marketed with erroneous requests, the company must be able to show the associated audit trail. That audit trail will be scrutinised. If it is determined that you maliciously interfered with the system, you are going to jail, for a really long time. On the other hand, if it was an honest mistake and you followed the process, the firm will write it off as a loss and no one will hold it against you.

A similar process is followed if any production data needs to be changed - someone will perform and test the change, another person will review, managers will sign off and this will be all logged.

&gt; A malicious employee can do this with an audit trail. All he has to do is install that malware at the same time he's installing legitimate software that's been requested.

Employees aren't actually allowed to install anything. They can request things from a (substantial) curated catalog of firm-approved software. Then these are installed, subject to approvals, by an automated process. At no point will the employee have admin rights to install random software.

&gt; They can do this without installing any malware. If you want to prevent data from being exfiltrated, lock down access to websites that allow you to upload files, lock down USB ports, monitor every outbound email.

What do you think they're doing right now? There is a sophisticated firewall which blocks any sites deemed non-compliant, USBs don't work (other than as phone chargers) and all emails are monitored for suspicious activity (e.g. sending confidential info out of the network), as well as logged for a really long time. All of these things are also regulatory requirements. 

The top investment banks take information and systems security very seriously. For hackers, companies like JPMC/Citi are inherently better targets because they have substantial retail banking businesses, which directly translates to larger attack surfaces.",2015-03-02 01:38:02,cp0ya8y,6,cscareerquestions

LiesForNoReason,"JP Morgan Chase bank. True fucking story. No banking, no loans, no debit cards, nothing that this company does. Why? Well this might not be your average reason but here goes. 


Years ago, I was 17. I was working for the company that created the food stamp and unemployment cards, yep JPMC. I carpooled with my best friend who also got a job there. She was much better at our job and I expected her to be my boss one day. 

One day, I'm on a war call with a client. I can't get off they phone and my friend is sent to 15 minute break alone. After about 20 minutes I started to worry. She wasn't back yet.  I was panicking a bit and I even called my boss to find out if I can go to break (that I planned using to find her.) 

Just as I had that thought she comes back to her desk. She didn't look up. I could tell something was very wrong. So I called her extention and asked what was wrong. She said nothing. I said that I could tell something was wrong. She started bawling mumbling about ""it actually happened."" Something I didn't get at the moment.

We had a creepy guy that was working as a security guard there. He followed us everywhere, even to our cars, and he was such a pervert. He became the resident joke. He was fat, short, in his 50s. He abused his power and ended up tripping her, forcing her into the bathroom where he sexually assaulted her. 

I called my boss and told her, though my friend already had and went back to work. She was very work oriented. She couldn't work like this. Our manager lead us out the back so we can go to police. She was a wreck. 

So the following day she talks to HR who asked what could make her feel safe. All she asked for was them not to split breaks again at night. All she wanted was to stay on break schedule so she didn't have to go alone. 

The next day there's a note on my desk And THE DESK OF EVERYONE WHO WORKS THERE saying we specifically can't go on break with her, by name. The one on her desk said she was too be alone. 

She went back to hr saying, wait, you asked how to keep me safe and do the opposite? Hr told her if she didn't like it she was fired. She said she'd deal and hr then stated ""No, you're fired and your friend is fired too."" That's how I lost my job and I still have no explanation for it. 


My friend lost everything she believed about the world and for an entire year she refused to leave her house. She didn't leave for a while year, when she finally did she had a panic attack and shat herself. She was afraid he would find her again. 


Why Chase? Well, my friend had been in a lawsuit since this happened about 10 years ago. They lied, ""lost security cameras,"" made her live every graphic detail over and over and over, called me to testify and completely ruined the person my friend was. My friend hasn't been able to get a job or anything. You know what she walked away with after all of this? 15k. Yes $15,000. After losing a years worth of work, attorney fees, etc what did she really walk away with after being nearly raped and being assaulted, paying psychologists, paying for medicine, lawyers, filling fees, and everything? 

She walks away owing more than 3x what they paid out.


So JP Morgan Chase, because you fired me for no reason, ruined my friend, fucked lives and all because she was a liability once she got assaulted... You'll never get a fucking penny from me and everyone I ever talk to online and off will know all about how you treat your employees. If you're own are worthless to you, what about your customers? This is why JPMC can suck my fucking dick. 

If I knew how to make something viral, even if just to give them a bit of panic for RUINING A LIFE WITH NO GUILT I would do it in a heart beat. These people don't deserve your money. I miss my friend. :(",2015-02-07 02:59:50,codbjmi,259,AskReddit
geekonamotorcycle,"I can tell you what I did.
I have no ba, no associates and no certs.
My first IT job was @ verizons internal and ITo help desk. This jobs sucked and I maxed out around 12$ an hour, but I always looked at it as getting my foot in the door since I had no credentials. After almost 4 years I got laid off. No biggie. The connections I made there got me a help desk job @ Ciber. I tested into working overflow which meant I serviced all of the companies that Ciber had contracts with. After a year I was selected to work on Their largest contract with an energy company in the Midwest.

 After about another year I started writing all the documentation for the help desk(I still do the majority of this everywhere I go). Eventually I started doing light data sec work for them. So my job became working the phones for 4 hours and then working other projects (docs, sec tickets, sccm work etc) 

Then I got laid off again.

My experience and good testing  landed me a data sec/techops job as a contractor at JP Morgan where I perform file share remediation for all of their lines of business. I get a lot of autonomy and am treated very well. Once there I was able to use all tools at my disposal to solve problems and projects (being trusted after working help desk for so long feels good man) Then JP Morgan hired me as an enployee. 

Then they laid me off. The thing is though, when you get into specialty fields at large corporations a layoff is 60 days notice, placement assistance and severance pay. So essentially I get 3 months of pay to find another job. While performing this job I picked up .net developing skills from their internal education system(my freedom included the freedom to write my own tools). Now it looks like I'm getting a promotion within Jpmc so I won't be losong my job after all and I will be doing database work. After a certain amount of time you begin to know how everything works intuitively and picking up new skills is easy peasy(especially in wintel)

IT is a great field. Sure it helps to have certs and a degree but its one of the last fields where you can rise through merit, even if it takes a bit longer. Once you are in, you are in and your accomplishments become more important than certs degrees etc.

Get a help desk job if that's easy and volunteer for everything is my advice and work on communicating with management. Become a subject matter specialist whenever possible. Be the guy that management goes to to get something done and if you need to write an app, script or query, think two steps ahead and build that in too(comment it out and have it ready when they inevitably ask for it).",2015-02-06 12:15:52,cocrswj,1,ITdept

I don't see how the DoJ's wilful ignorance would have been at all helped by a public verifiable ledger. It would have been more obvious that they are doing it I suppose but as-is everyone is well aware of the outcome and appropriately (though impotently) outraged. And here as well btw, I really don't think it's the DoJ itself that's ""corrupt"" - the DoJ does as its told, and it was clearly told in this case that JPMC should not be allowed to fail. 

My point is that a cyrptocurrency and decentralized ledgers and other such exotic doodads are a mechanism by which to implement policy goals, and very poorly suited for that job comparing to direct administration by professionals / actual humans. State mechanisms and government bureaucracies is actually quite effective at meeting the goals imposed on them. They struggle when they receive conflicting goals or are starved of funding or intentionally sabotaged for political purposes, but the problem is only very very rarely that the civil servants involved are just so gosh-darn corruptible and unreliable and ought to be replaced with machine code.

At least in the developed world. In places where the state is weak and the government machinery poorly established, there might be a place for this wacky stuff, though there will usually be much bigger fish to fry in such places.",2015-01-02 01:21:05,cnb9z1v,1,socialjustice
[deleted],"Apparently they are working on fixing it. 

&gt;I just emailed them about this a month ago. This was the reply that I got:
To prevent brute force attacks, Schwab.com user profiles are automatically locked when an incorrect password is entered 3 times. If this happens, the account holder must call our client service line to authenticate before he or she will be able to re-gain access to the accounts.
This being said, we recognize that many clients prefer a more complex password. I am happy to confirm that a project is currently in-the-works that will allow Schwab clients to lengthen passwords to 20 characters, while adding case sensitivity and special characters. I do not have an estimated timeframe for when this feature will be implemented, but we look forward to allowing Schwab clients this option in the near future.
In the meantime, Schwab offers an additional layer of security using token authentication for electronic products. A Schwab Security Token displays a randomly generated 6-digit passcode that is used in combination with your regular web password.

&gt; Unfortunately this post will probably be buried, but - I may possibly be or was an employee in a related department for JPMC, and I can give you some insight, based on seeing hundreds of compromised online accounts.
I would like to make this as clear as possible:
**It does not matter what the password is to your bank account.**
The only thing that matters is that you do not use the same password for your bank as you do for other things, especially email. If you feel uncomfortable having an easier password, feel free to put symbols in or make it longer - chase.com allows up to 32 characters. Regardless,
It does not matter what the password is to your bank account.
There are two main ways in which your online access at Chase.com is compromised:
You Have A Virus. The most common variant keylogs and will also try to steal cookies. Generally they'll also try to steal your email login information, to use that to bypass the 2-factor authentication.
You Gave It Away. Possibly to someone on the phone, or an email or fake web page. In some cases you'll give it away because you have a virus and it pops up a fake Chase.com page to collect all of your account information. Then the fraudsters use whatever they've collected, call in to the phone center and reset the password. Boom, access.
These aren't all the ways you can get broken into, and there are several variants for each main method - some of which are incredibly sophisticated. It probably represents about 75% of comprimises.
So, how do I protect myself?
Your torrent computer should not be your banking computer. Make sure your computer is up to date and uses an antivirus, but beware - antiviruses have a very hard time picking up many of these viruses, as they aren't attacking the computer directly and the fingerprint changes very quickly. If you torrent or go to skeevy porn sites (you know who you are) use a different system for that, or use a live Linux disk or a Linux install for banking.
Be cautious with your information. Chase will never ask you to 'verify' any account-related details or personal security details online.
Chase does not have anywhere on any website where you are requested to enter:
Mother's maiden name
Credit or debit card expiration date
Credit or debit CVV2 security code
Mother's maiden name
The only place on Chase.com you might enter any information is if you forget your password - and then it asks only for your SSN and only for your account or card number. They're never going to email you or call you and ask you to verify personal security questions. In some very rare cases card security or online security might call you about a transaction. If you aren't absolutely sure you're talking to a legit person, thank them and ask what department they're calling from. Then, call back at the number on your card or on Chase.com and ask to speak with that department. That way you know 100% that you're talking to the bank.
Ensure your contact information is current. Not only do you get automated alerts any time passwords are reset through the website and when contact information is changed, security teams will also try to call to verify transactions and activity that looks possibly fraudulent. If your information isn't up to date it can take several days sometimes for you to find out what happened, and in that case there could be loss due to fraud or you could have payments you wanted to go out blocked.
tl;dr
Don't worry about your password, just make sure it's unique. Use a computer with current security and don't use the same computer to download shifty files. Make sure the bank can contact you when it's important, but be cautious about contact you're not expecting.

So you might have white male candidates interviewed on the roles with no chance at the role, white females too if they needed to hit metrics for specific types of race.  But to follow back, creating a handful of reqs designed to increase diversity is a drop in the bucket.

truth-is-treason,"&gt;So when it's Christianity you're allowed to just throw out tenets you don't believe in

No, only criminals of which there are many among high ranks of the financial industry. JPMC, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc. have been involved in everything from laundering drug money for various cartels to wire fraud, mortgage fraud, LIBOR rigging, stealing from public pensions, gold price manipulation, huge numbers of fraudulent foreclosures, rampant insider trading, unlawful ‚ÄúWash Trades‚Äù to manipulate asset prices, charging veterans unlawful mortgage fees, cooking their books, bribing and bullying ratings agencies to inflate ratings on their risky investments, charging people for gold storage without ever actually purchasing or storing any gold- huge fraud, various Ponzi schemes- http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/in-prison-madoff-says-banks-had-to-know-of-fraud/?_r=0 and that's just the tip of the iceberg. So many of these people should be in jail but instead they are the ""advisors"" to all the Presidents past and future. They occupy high ranking positions on regulatory boards. We bailed them out and the Fed threw a ton of money at them and now wealthy disparity is as great as the peak of the 1929 stock market bubble. 

NOT PERSECUTION....JUSTICE. If an average person engaged in a small fraction of that partial list of crimes committed by the banks they would be in jail for a very long time.

marshyme13,"Any references to J P Morgan I made are to JP Morgan-Chase, which is a bank. J P Morgan the person was a real guy, he started J P Morgan The Bank which is presently JP Morgan-Chase. 

So it's not one person dishing out the $9 billion (not million, *billion*), it's the company as a whole. In 2012 their yearly revenue was close to $100 billion, while net income was only $10 billion, so the fine would count for a years worth of profit. (They do have, oh, $2.5 trillion in assets that they could sell if they need, though.)  Source: [wikipedia]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase)


Well, they would be caught, but only if the US government agencies that monitors that type of fraud does an investigation and brings them to court for that specific crime. According to The Rolling Stone interview, The FCC (maybe a different agency) was doing an investigation and was *going* to take JPMC to court, but JPMC offered to just pay the fine straight up, and settle the proceedings without a public trial.

(In order to prove the fraud, they have to prove that the people involved knew that they were lying, and intended to commit fraud. To do this, witnesses would help, as much of the lying about the loans was verbal, as well as pulling the data from their computers and emails showing that they knew the loans were bad and that they altered the information about the loans.) 

By settling it just between lawyers, instead of the public trial, JPMC was charged for a smaller crime as a whole company, and the FCC then said ""Oh ok, JPMC made a mistake but now they've paid the fine, it wasn't a big deal"". In doing this, JPMC comes off as a reliable company, so their stock value increased and the overall value of their company ended up higher, despite losing $9.billion in cash. They earned some $15 billion by doing that, if I recall correctly.

Tldr JPMC paid a moderate fine and settled things lawyer to lawyer, ends up looking good and gaining stock value, earning even more money from shady dealings.

The important thing from all of this is that **JPMC the company is being persecuted and fined, not the employees that committed the fraud**. 

The employees in the regulation department, the bosses that strong-armed people into certifying the bad loans, the JPMC lawyers that lied about Alayne (the lady will all of the secrets, from the Rolling Stone interview) and kept her from testifying,I think the CEO of JPMC made public statements about the ordeal as well, none of these people are punished. The company earned money overall, so they aren't hurt, and the employees of the company that lied and hid things and actually committed the fraud, they aren't punished in the slightest. 

JPMC paid $9 billion to protect the higher-ups and all those that did the fraud, and it earned them back even more than they paid. That's why Alayne did the interview with The Rolling Stone magazine.",2014-11-17 14:05:54,cm4sap2,1,explainlikeimfive

So the US/world economy could completely exist without the Fed Reserve system.  Could the US/World economy exist without the US Treasury and their precious bonds/bills/notes?   Nope.  ",2014-11-17 07:53:36,cm4hv16,2,changemyview

In 2006 or so, JPMorganChase bought a bunch of unsafe loans (loans that people weren't going to be able to pay back, making the bank lose money).

Then, the review department was strong-armed into saying these unsafe loans were high-quality ""grade A"" loans.

Alayne, the lady being interviewed, was part of the review department. She saw that these were unsafe loans and tried to stop JPMC from selling them as Grade A. She was yelled at, her coworkers were yelled at, eventually other people on the review department gave up and certified the loans as Grade A.  

Alayne was fired, and JPMC was able to start selling the loans, because no one else knew they were bad. This is fraud.

The housing market crashed in 2008 because of unsafe loans (like the ones JPMC lied about), JPMC helped cause this crazy by lying about and selling bad loans.

US government officials investigated, were lied to and slowed down by JPMC lawyers, officials, workers, anyone that was involved. Hudson, the main investigator, helped cover it up by being slow and investigating poorly, and giving press conferences saying ""we're doing our best"" but not actually punishing JPMC. 

Eventually, JPMC agreed to ""admit guilt"" to the US government and pay a $6 billion fine, instead of going to court. The US officials said no, so JPMC said ""well what if I pay a THIRTEEN billion dollar fine"" and the US investigators agreed (corruption and shady deals). It was actually a $9 billion fine, because $4bil was for compensation to the homeowners with mortgages, which JPMC didn't really do.

Alayne, the lady being interviewed, was there when JPMC committed the fraud of lying about the quality of the loans. When she was fired, she had to sign a nondisclosure agreement, to protect the secrets of JPMC where she worked (that's normal). US government investigators contacted her and interviewed her many times over the past 8 years, but as I said above they did very little, and never fully punished JPMC for the bad acts. 

Now there is another ongoing investigation, she doesn't know how that will go, and she finally broke her nondisclosure agreement and spilled the whole story to The Rolling Stone in an interview.


Tldr: JPMC lies about loans, Alayne is fired for trying to stop them, housing market crashes, government ""investigates"", story and corruption are covered up, JPMC pays a small fine to cover it up more, Alayne wasn't supposed to say anything, now she's spilled the beans.

Alayne F worked at JPMC and tried to stop them from committing fraud that helped crash the housing market in 2008.

JPMC paid the government a **$9 billion** fine to stop them from calling her as a **witness** in the court case against JPMC.

TheCreepingKid,"Dude shut the fuck up. I have lived in the ghetto of chattanooga Tennessee, trailer parks in Florida, and complete shit holes in Georgia as a kid. I grew up in what was only barely above abject poverty.

 My parents both went to prison at the same time and I moved in with my grandparents in South eastern PA. Completely fucking different universe. I have seen both sides of the coin. I personally know several people who work at companies such as vanguard, JPMC, and a couple others, and YES, it is fucking corporate America's fault for modern black culture. 

Two things shape a society more than any other, and those are education and the media. Education in urban environments is bordering on non-existant, it is virtually impossible for a black family to get a good education for their child, who is subjected to the social memes of their constituents. This lack of education, and exposure to he culture that results from it, creates a self-sustaining production line of uneducated, easily controlled, cheap labor that has facilitated the unprecedented economic growth that this country has relied on for the past hundred+ years. Racism never went away, its just legal now. It isn't limited to black culture, red necks are EXACTLY THE SAME (although religious extremism also has a hand in their situation)

America, and the entire developed world relies on social engineering and slave labor to function.

Jasonlovestummyrub,"Prior JPMC recruiter here.

The ongoing joke / not joke in HR is that, rather than give a person an adequate raise for good performance, the person has to leave and come back to the company for a reasonable bump.

Otherwise, a good employee will likely only see 1-3k increases each year.

Best example I have is one lady, started as a personal teller at like 11/hr, after 2 years, was hired on as a full business analyst at like 30k.   This woman kept that role, securing meets or exceed performance rankings each year and after about 8 years of doing this (and making a 602 leveling) was only at 44k as a base.   Now, JPMC also has a program wherein they hire entry level BAs straight out of college.  Average starting base for those BAs?  55k.

This is why the thought process around benefits and comp increase needs real overhaul.  

Secondly, corporations need to give REAL thought to putting a job out to a staffing agency.  I've seen a handful out entry level roles to a staffing company at 20% staffing fee on the base.

The bank is subject to an Office of Comptroller and Currency (""OCC"") Consent Order, which just simply means the OCC gives a list of demands and conditions that the firm must obey and in return the OCC doesn't take action against the bank. JPMChase is the result of many different mergers over the years, including taking on Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. When a corporate merger occurs the resulting entity has both the assets *and* the liabilities of the previous entities. This Consent Order stems from many different things, related to the many different firms that make up JPMC, including Madoff's shenanigans at Bear Stearns (the Government begged Chase to save Bear) and WaMu's liabilities related to the mortgage crisis. 
The Consent Order is huge and has many different parts to it, but one part in particular requires the bank to continuously review it's customers to determine if they are involved in any illegal activity.

More valuable, yes. 300 times more? Not at all. A CEO can't physically or mentally do 300 times worth of work in the same time as any of their average employees. Do they do things their average employees can't? Absolutely! And that's what makes them valuable, the lack of others available and/or needed to do the work. But there's nothing that can't be managed by persons directly underneath them and/or with proper education/training for the position. 

At any given McDonald's location, everyone can flip the burgers and fry the fries, but while not everyone needs to those things, a lot of the staff does do. Compared to someone who does the payroll for the same McDonald's, there might be one or two people that do it, as that's all that is needed. Does it make those people who do payroll now valuable? Absolutely! But not 300, 100, or even 2 times as valuable.

Should also mention that when a bank creates credit for a loan out of thin air, they do not create the interest. The current system is set up so that it is a mathematic impossibility for everyone to pay off the loans; the interest is never created. Interest is paid back from the existing principal in circulation; a large number of people will always come up short because there is a shortage of money at all times.

[deleted],"Ugh, sorry. Drunkenness + finance geekery is pretty unconducive to actual information-sharing.

Taxi medallions/licenses are heavily financed using debt--principally in the form of commercial loans. The structure of these loans is usually interest-only, 3 year balloon, with borrowers qualified on a 40 year amortization period. Sound familiar? I'll give you a hint: rhymes with smeal shmestate shmubble. The loans then get chopped up and hawked to local community lenders, who are told that the prices never go down (because supply-side monopoly), and then they happily up the concentration of taxi financing in their lending portfolios.

Your observation is trenchant. Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, all that shit comes into the picture and there's no hail. So they're not really taxis, meaning they skirt regulation. And to make matters worse, they are also heavily financed through VC, PE, short-term bank debt. And they use that financing to do what? Not operations--instead, they just lower their prices, and usually below that of traditional cabs. It's an artificially deflated price designed to hook folks on the service, and then when they start not being able to subsidize their prices anymore, they'll raise em back up (but consumers don't care about that in the short run).

Why does any of this matter? Because when the e-collective cited above comes in and creates stiff competition, demand for medallion falls because cab drivers would rather go work for Uber (they don't need to license their right to drive from a cab fleet anymore), and also demand for cabs themselves falls because people would rather take the cheaper alternative. That causes the cost of medallions to fall, which = price correction. And that's bad because it's not the guys originating and hawking these loans who are on the hook--they've effectively sold off their share of the loan to other lenders (community banks) and cashed out. Instead, you're looking at mom and pop banks who are now on the hook for these loans where the value of the loan grossly exceeds the value of the collateral, the medallion, the thing they were supposed to partially finance.

This is the same phenomenon as what happened in 08. Real estate prices experience a substantial price correction because of, well, a bunch of shit, but let's just say that it had to do with the financing arrangements that made real estate safe in the first place + shitty loan underwriting standards. All of a sudden you had people with 500K houses that they took out a 1.2m mortgage for. Rational actors, true to their word, just walked away from the house--just packed up their shit and moved somewhere else, and just said to the bank ""here's the keys, I can't afford this shit"". And the bank can't take any of their stuff because the mortgage terms were essentially for the value of the collateral. So now you have all these banks that are short on liquid assets--they have residential properties, but nobody's buying, at least not at the prices that they need to get the return on their investment.

This is all a really long way of saying this: if there is a mass price correction caused by Uber, it's going to be mom and pop banks on the hook for the loans. Borrowers will flee en masse to Uber et al, while banks will experience serious liquidity issues. You're right that Uber is doing something great by forcing taxi cabs into a non-monopolistic situation, but the first step needs to be unwinding the debt on these loans. Otherwise, you're looking at a mini market crash that could be disastrous for grandma and grandpa in Mendocino County.

InfoTroll4Hire,"&gt;I prefer to get the mess of the bubble bursting out of the way before it gets bigger and the damage much worse.

&gt;There is no bubble. 

You're misunderstanding me, the reason we need 0% rates is because we have an economic model that is completely unsustainable. Low rates give us the illusion that we're trudging along, but at its core the economy is very sick. Like I said 90million out of work, 47 million on food stamps, full time jobs are *net* disappearing quarter after quarter and being replaced with low paying jobs in the service sector, hospitality and part-time jobs. There has been some growth in manufacturing (but no where near what we've lost in the past couple decades). You want to know where the middle class's wealth went, check out chart http://macromon.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/u-s-employment-in-manufacturing.jpg Notice that its decline (during a time of huge population expansion) correlates with increase in the consumer sector. Manufacturing is a huge source of real wealth creation for any nation. The last time we had this large of a percentage of the population out of the labor force was  1978(at the height of stagflation). As far as I can tell this ""recovery"" is not long term sustainable, it's more like a bubble for the 1%; a bubble in stocks, bonds, and many other assets are inflated. 

there is a lot of malinvestment in this market. people are valuing stocks/bonds just based on zero rates (anything is better than cash in the bank guaranteed to loose purchasing power). Heard mentality of people rushing into the market, indexing is also causing malinvestment in the stock market (indiscriminate buying). The banks are sitting on a ton of garbage loans and have not marked to market. The size of retail is just too large as is finance. The last time we had wealth inequality this high was the late 1920s, and I don't need to remind you how much fun the 1930s were. 

&gt;You'll be waiting for quite some time.

I don't have to wait very long for us to be in recession again and then we'll see who's swimming naked and who is economically viable for the state of the capital market and can sustain themselves. Of course that is, until the government comes rushing in to bailout the banks again and runs huge deficits and the Fed reflates the system with QE to infinity (which is the exact opposite of the nonintervention the Fed and government should practice). we are projected to run trillion dollar deficits from 2015 and beyond even if we don't enter recession. Medicare will not have sufficient funds to meet it's obligations in 2024. This model absolutely cannot be sustained. What I'm really saying is that the government absolutely must also make structural changes and make serious cuts or we are doomed anyway. Also I agree with the BIS when they say ""to bring forth the downward leg"" in the market now rather than let huge excesses continue and make the necessary correction that much worse. http://notquant.com/did-the-bis-just-call-for-a-collapse/ The reason we have to have another recession is because we didn't let the one in 08' run its course, we reflated and stimulated. If the Fed and the government refuse to allow correction to occur and put up a massive effort to fight the market eventually they will destroy the dollar and the economy. 

&gt;debts are paid down or defaulted on, savings increase,

&gt;Savings decrease as the investments people hold are defaulted on. One man's debt is another man's asset. This is a reflexive spiral that will destroy our complex economy. Our economy isn't just a bunch of farms and assembly lines you can just turn off and then turn back on a month later. 

However a lot of the money that will be destroyed isn't doing anything productive for the US economy right now anyway.  For example subprime mortgages and liar prime loans weren't productive in 02'-08'. Some lenders might have *thought* that they had an asset but what they really had was a piece of crap, and it's a good thing it was destroyed. Brokerage accounts will deflate, the megacorporations won't have as much money for share-buybacks, the banks that are sitting on bad loans will go under. 

This is what I think is going to happen regardless if you raise rates or not, it will just take longer to occur and worse if you don't raise rates. when the financial bubble we are building bursts, faux wealth will be wiped out, much of it was never real wealth to begin with. If a company happens to be invested in garbage then it is necessary for them to loose their money to clear out malinvestment. Unfortunately because of stupid decisions made by banks and corporations large and small alike, many small businesses will definitely be hurt and some will fail. 

Austrians see this malinvestment that is a result of distorted market signals from low interest rates, monetary expansion and government intervention as having a pendulum effect, where all the market gains that were the result of malinvestment must be wiped out, meaning that as sharp as a move as we had going up we need an equal sized move in the opposite direction in order to clear the market and have a real recovery. The Fed needs to end QE and sell MBSs and tighten. The market is too complacent, investors need to see that there is risk, so that they are cautious and frugal. Retail and the financial sector must necessarily shrink. A lot of retailers have to fail for us to make necessary structural changes in the economy, as stated the middle class has no savings and can't sustain them, they must contract until we can produce enough real economic growth for the country to sustain them. I'm sure some retailers will hold up better in places like Washington DC, North Dakota (oil boom town) and other wealthy areas. 
&gt;the people go back to work as a real recovery takes hold

&gt;How does this magically happen? How does the recovery take hold?

&gt;when the price is dropping it's a market signal that it's too high in supply or low in demand and we don't need more of it.

&gt;Agreed. You desire deflation economy wide though. Deflation means we don't need more production -&gt; we won't have more production -&gt; you're ""booming recovery"" is a generational depression

The part you left out: eventually bear markets in price lead to less production **which leads to a Bull market in price and more production.** No need to interfere with the natural ebb and flow of the market.

Lower prices on productive assets (if partnered with favorable government policy toward production) will eventually beget more buying of those assets and more production. There's a lot of money on the sidelines (both domestic and foreign) that will scoop up assets, reorganize them, and return them to productive capacity.   

&gt;A tremendous amount of productive assets would be dragged through bankruptcy court (this would take decades). Lehman BK alone is still stuffing Manhattan courts. 

In this case what you call a productive asset I would call trash. It's necessary for these companies to fail, they were misallocating capital. You don't take money from competent people to bail out incompetent people and think that you're going to have a productive economy. I think that if not bailed out again large banks would fail, but the smaller banks have been more conservative and would gain market share. Many businesses fail yes, but it gives new people a chance to takeover their assets and reorganize. During the bear market, the economy realigns with the true state of the capital markets. If you're leveraged up 50x when this happens then you are only recklessly misallocating capital and you deserve to fail. Many financial companies will loose a lot of money, but a lot of small businesses and other private investors aren't as leveraged and will hold up better and start new businesses for cheap as the big boys fail which will eventually allow them to gain market share.     


&gt;Good luck getting DIP financing in this type of environment. As ownership would be contested, capital assets would simply deteriorate. Human capital would deteriorate. 

Nothing will be resolved if pro-growth reforms aren't adopted. Taxes on small business need to be at parity with the large, the more successful a small business the more the government penalizes you with higher taxes and more regulations. I already ranted on this so I won't repeat. I did want to mention again though that I think the tax deduction for political donations, tax expensing of options, mortgage interest rate deduction, farm subsidies, is bullshit. Can I or any sole proprietor or partnership expense options to avoid paying individual income taxes on a business that I/they already own 100% of without the IRS locking me up for tax fraud? It is not fair that GE and many others never pay (/pay very little) corporate tax and shareholders and passive income is taxed much less than small businesses. What we need is lower tax rates and less deductions.
&gt;Who will employ these people and where will the demand come from for their goods? You think foreigners are simply gonna be cranking up spending as the US collapses into depression? They'll crash even harder. 

I think we're all going to crash again regardless, a repeat of 08'. I also think that foreigners would take many of their US dollars and buy productive assets here in the US as would many US citizens if the prices got really cheap though. Eventually you hit rock bottom and can only go up from there (unless you keep on repeating the same stupid ass mistakes over and over then you're just doomed). 

&gt;Free reserve lending is what spawned the creation of interest on deposits

&gt;You've been yelling against fractional reserve banking 

As I have also mentioned all week my problems with 1-10 fractional-reserve lending *under a fiat currency* is as follows:

1)the fact that it by nature causes crises when the principal+interest owed becomes much greater than principal only in existence there is no way to pay off all debts and so massive defaults are part of its design. Under a gold standard you could mine more gold to pay off interest. I should say, I don't really care about gold either but it would be helpful for the economy to be able to pay off interest with some type other type of asset, maybe both fiat created from debt and redeemable gold/silver/platinum/palladium notes created from underlying value in circulation concurrently? I don't know, I just know that the current system is unsustainable. It requires the constant expansion of credit (and a lot of this goes into malinvestment) and every time credit contracts, it's a catastrophe. The world can't be bulled up on credit all the time. 

2) The extreme credit creation encourages leverage, excessive risk taking, creates inflation which causes wealth transfer and diverts resources and allows malinvestment to continue for longer than market conditions would permit.

3) Banks have proven themselves incapable of making wise decisions regarding their investments, the evidence is that their sitting on a ton of crap right now and have leveraged up even further. Derivatives time bomb (which is a consequence of monetary expansion having a whole lot of hot money flowing through finance) will eventually take down many large banks. Bank CEOs encourage leverage because if their bets work out it enhances profits and therefore enhances bonuses. Most banks that were owner operated partnerships were much less inclined to take excessive risks than publicly trade shareholders and CEOs concerned only with short term profits.
 
4) Banks pay no interest for the risk depositors take by crediting them their savings and they are able to create more inflation under a fiat currency. Again the original terms that were adopted with fractional reserve lending was interest payments on deposits. 

&gt;That has absolutely nothing to do with leverage

&gt;The loans to shitty mediterranean countries are specifically due to German trade surplus.

I agree, but I still don't understand why the money has to get invested in shitty loans instead of productive asset purchases.

&gt;Swiss banks see a lot of money come in from tax avoiders of foreign lands, it makes sense that their banks are large. 

&gt;Ahh, so having banks 5X the size of GDP is okay for Swiss, but 1X US GDP is the end of the world.


Wasn't applauding, just saying it makes sense, in the same way you said current US college tuition prices make sense. Most of the Swiss banks liabilities are deposits, not as leveraged as US banks. We are also forgetting that banks' assets are now marked to whatever the hell they feel like but if the assets they report were to be trusted: UBS assets roughly $1.3trillion, Credit Suisse has around $924billion in assets (Swiss GDP=$593billion). JPMC has about 2.4trillion in assets (and $87trillion in derivatives). http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2013/06/05/americas-biggest-banks-jpmorgan-takes-a-bigger-lead-over-bank-of-america/ Again if I were to mark my assets the same way as banks, I'd say I have a least a billion dollars worth of assets in my septic tank.

&gt;Finance doesn't consume as big a share of domestic profits as US banks do though
&gt;You don't consume profits, you produce profits. Swiss finance consumes more of GDP than US finance does.

If you're not producing real wealth then you're consuming it. Finance doesn't produce anything except paper assets which aren't real wealth. Productive industry produces real wealth and produces profits. Finance and creation of new money/credit/paper reallocates the existing resources in the economy to the financial sector and finance consumes profits from this process. Remember when a bank makes a loan the credit comes from nothing, only the producer of the underlying asset (house to mortgage, car to auto loan, stock to margin loan) created tangible wealth. Banks consume profits from the labor of producers. The increase in the amount of paper/credit in circulation is what increases their profits by necessarily shrinking the value of everyone else's claim's on the real tangible wealth that the economy has produced. 

&gt;and the Swiss have a strong economy and high wages/savings because of their productive industries.
&gt;And they have this while having a massively outsized banking system and negative interest rates. MAYBE a large banking system and low interest rates isn't at fault for all the problems you see????

Culture is obviously very important. They have a more well educated population than the US and in many cases better government economic policies. They encourage production and heavily tax all consumption (which encourages savings). They have negative interest rates b/c every country around them is trying to devalue their own currencies and that had investors rapidly bidding up the Swiss Franc too high too fast and the Swiss needed to do something to curb the hot money flowing in.

Anyway, most of the cases against chase revolved around 1 of two things. Either they were giving people predatory loans they knew the people couldn't pay or their bank securities? (Im not sure what they are but its like groups of loans they sell or something like that).

Case 1. There was a law in place because some idiotic politicians said you cannot deny people loans based on income. So there were loan applications in place where the buyer would say ""I need a 200k loan"" The loan officer would then say ""You need to make 65k a year for this load. Do you make that much?"" If the buyer said yes, thats it, loan approved. But what happened was many many people lied about their income to try and buy something they couldn't afford (which is a felony) Now proving that all these people lied about their income at they time? that probable costs a lot of fucking money. 

Case 2. These loan security things were analyzed by the top financial analysts using the best software, but they had no idea what they were doing. They would give these A+ ratings to securities that should have been rated C or below. People would buy them and then be disappointed when no one in the security could pay there damn mortgage. Who's fault was it in this case? The buyer of the security and the financial analysts. But proving this, also expensive. 

**TLDR** People lied about there income to buy loans they couldn't afford. But proving this is extremely expensive. Remember the government is really good at wasting time and time=money.

Note. I could be wrong on a couple different aspects here. Like I've said - I am no expert, this is what I remember of a conversation I had with my dad.

If you think you can do a double major the you'll have to throw the immersion out and the immersion becomes essentially whatever the second major is. In my opinion the double major is going to be more valuable then a minor and immersion combined.

I've attempted to layout what I think are a the most relevant choices that you have. Keep in mind that I am no academic advisor and am just giving you the information that I have gained through personal experience. 

Opt 1: Double Major (econ &amp; finance), difficulty=7/10, most valuable in mid-level financial industry (think smaller niche investment firms and boutique shops)

Opt 2: Double Major (econ &amp; math/stat), difficulty=9/10, most valuable in gov't, academia and top level finance/econ firms (think Goldman, JPMC, the Fed, NBER, and strong PhD/MS candidate) 

Opt 3: Major in econ &amp; minor in applied stat and/or Portuguese, difficulty=6/10, most valuable for mid level finance or any large firm regardless of industry or less competitive postgrad schools. This option is also the one that produces the most well rounded person (arguably the point of education).

To conclude I've just laid out what I see as your most relevant options. The difficulty level is completely subjective, as is where a degree can take your career. The end result is completely based on how you leverage your skills and the networking you do. That being said, don't pigeon hole yourself.

Who the f**k wants ""just another"" anything? 

You need to make your resume stand out.  I'm not talking about printing it on dayglow paper. Change it up a little. Look at everyone else's resume, and figure out their common theme. Then vary that so that your's looks different. You don't want it to be non-standard such that they pitch it, just different enough that it catches the eye.  

**TL; DR:** Build a network, and don't just blend into the crowd.

**edit**: If it were me, I would avoid the giants (JPMC, Cardinal Health, Nationwide, OhioHealth, L-Brands, Ohio State Univ, Ohio State Medical Center...) but go HARD after the second tier employers... Abercrombie, Huntington, AEP, NetJets, NiSource, Alliance Data... there's typically more turnover, thus more frequent openings at those second tier places.  Plus, because they turn over more, there's more room for advancement, compared to the big behemoths.  Also don't forget about the finance audit types - KPMG, PWC, etc. They're always bringing in new talent at the analyst level then work them up the chain.

People would certainly invest with JPMorgan Securities at least in part because Dimon is CEO. If the investment business is strong, there's a good chance that the other parts of consumer banking will be strong, thus people will want to do business with JPMC.

There is also a good chance that, even if people don't know who Jamie Dimon is, they are unknowingly doing business with JPMC due at least in part to the fact that he is at the wheel. As far as investor confidence (and thus, strength of the bank) goes, Jamie Dimon is an excellent CEO.

drenchrome,"The framers of our constitution were all too familiar with human nature and risk of corruption.  When Franklin was asked what the constitution gave us he said ""A Republic, sirs if you can keep it.""

You have a choice between having one power which is nominally answerable to the people or multiple powers answerable to nobody.  Without regulation, corporations (which are chartered by government by the way) are not even answerable to their investors (owners).

Our regulatory state evolved out of two periods where capital exerted de-facto ownership of government.

The corruption we see today is due to the subversion of democracy.  Attempts at this were foreseen in the structure of the constitution.  I think they expected corruption of the executive branch and less so the legislative branch.  I don't think they could have dreamed of the level of complicity we see in the judicial branch.

You expressed an interest in preserving EPA.  Bummer.  Let's walk through a few regulatory agencies and catalog the types of regulatory capture going on:

EPA: oil, chemical, transportation, manufacturing

FCC: communications companies including media

SEC: the banking industry

FDA: the pharmaceutical and medical device industry

USDA: agribusiness and monsanto

Top positions at those agencies are staffed by people on a revolving door to the industries they're supposed to regulate.  If we're serious about being able to run our country, the answer is not to stop regulating.  The answer is to put a stop to the shenanigans.

Regulatory agencies like OSHA, NLRB or FTC that refuse to knuckle under to industry are badmouthed bitterly by capital-owned media.  One of the tricks used by the in-government cronies to accelerate regulatory capture is under-funding the agencies.  Why would I take $80k a year to work for SEC as a regulator when I can make 100x that working down the street for JPMC?  Why would I want to take that kind of money as a regulator when I can make 10x that on K Street helping to write the laws that govern my industry.

As for Scandanavia - population size and the value of the spoils is part of it but there are other factors as well.  It's harder for industry to play 'divide and conquer' with ethnically and culturally homogenous populations.  And their industry lacks the shamelessness of ours.

Right now there's nothing we can do to control government power.  When we try by putting up our own money to elect a Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders or Liz Warren, capital-owned media go ballistic and do everything they can to portray them as too extreme.

FWIW: There is nothing inherent in the structure of Google and Netflix that makes them any different from Comcast, Exxon-Mobil, JPMC and Archer Daniels Midland.

j75035,"I'm perplexed about this and hope it's just a misinterpretation of what the real policy of JPMC. If in fact, they are telling physicians with admitting rights in the hospital that they can not prescribe birth control, then I can see several possible legal angles for physicians/patients to take to prevent this. First the hospitals are presumably acting as suppliers (hospital beds, etc.) to the physicians (independent businesses) and are restraining their trade. In addition, with HIPPA laws in place, it would be hard to see how JPMC could even identify physicians who prescribe birth control let alone determine the reason it was prescribed.

Since this story is new and JPMC has not confirmed that this is their official position, it's probably best to wait until more is known. However, it is very frightening to see the number of people defending this. Medical decisions between a patient and physician should be and are a private matter. JPMC would have every right to not fill birth control prescriptions in their pharmacy (legal, although I would prefer to have federal legislation passed that forbids this practice) but no right to tell other pharmacies they can not fill these prescriptions.",2014-03-30 20:52:44,cgflujw,1,news

We also had a meeting that lasted a little over a half hour solely about how we were wasting too much time. We also had no interaction with any sort of customers yet were required to dress business casual, and one of the other sites were required to wear business professional. One day we were slow so they called a meeting and passed out sheets of paper with those stupid brainteasers (like [these](http://www.thecoachtoolkit.com/wp-content/uploads/Brain-Teasers.jpg)). They disallowed the use of the back row of computers because somebody left food wrappers on their desk, while the entire building was covered by cameras so they knew exactly who it was.

Granted JP Morgan's business practices are pretty shit and their upper management often makes blind ""if it works out in the short term screw the long term"" decisions, but they're still one of the biggest companies in the country, and I wouldn't be surprised if at least in any company that's big enough to delegate management duties as much as they do (on shift, assuming the site manager wasn't hanging around, we had a shift manager, then each department had a ""supervisor"" who basically delegated supervising duties to one or two team leads and took a two hour lunch) they have to find something to concentrate their attention to, and that's often as asinine as it was in high school.

There is an outstanding lawsuit on the issue alleging that OTS acted improperly (they had sufficient capitalization to survive the run for another week or so which would have given them time to get SFFed capitalization which would have got them past the duration of the run) and that JPMC (who ended up with most of the assets from FDIC) was the party who initiated the rumor in the first place (they had made several attempts to acquire WaMu).",2014-03-20 02:14:29,cg6o4jr,1,todayilearned

Even if you ignore the market drop (because it's notional, and was heading there anyway if you look at the past year's performance), you can't ignore the 12B USD expenditure on stabilizing the RUB, and the 150 bps increase in their base rate. That's $12B in cash that they basically blew to stop the RUB slide that they no longer have in their treasury. That's a very real increase in rates across the board by 1.5% that will have an immediate and real impact on their economy. 

And the above was in one day, all due to a market reaction without any concerted sanctions effort by the West. What will happen if the US issues actual sanctions and Russia ends up in the OFAC list? Will JPMC and Citi chose to do business in Russia and pull out of the US and EU, or will they drop Russia in a millisecond? What will happen to Russia's banking sector if Western Banks pull out? Will Alpha or Sberbank underwrite Russian corporate bonds? This is why a real cold war can't happen. World economies are too interconnected for real separation without a complete financial clusterfuck for anyone not in the Western banking system. 

We have a prime example of how Iran's economy behaved when it was cut off from SWIFT. Now, Russia is not Iran, but it's also heavily dependent on commodities, which means it's heavily dependent on global commodity markets and the associated derivatives markets. Iran still managed to sell its oil, but at a much lower cost. Can Russia's bureaucracy survive without the absolutely massive oil revenues gained from the state controlled companies?

Cash is a different although not unrelated issue.  Interstate cash movement is a fairly large indicator of money laundering.  For example, large cash deposits in Ohio with withdrawals in Texas \ New Mexico is indicative of Mexican meth with bulk cash smuggling back into Mexico.  Banks have to identify this movement of funds and submit SARs or exit the relationships of those found to be operating far enough outside of the norm.  The issue with allowing non-account holders to deposit funds is that they are in effect, anonymous.  Someone in Ohio can deposit funds into 100‚Äôs of accounts in Ohio at different banks and even different branches with no way of tying the entire relationship together.  If the bank does file SARs on the activity, it would only be on their client.  This would create hundreds of SARs with FINCEN with no connection to one another.  If you force the conductor to be on the account, FINCEN can start connecting the dots and see the entire relationship.",2014-03-12 23:03:35,cg0pxid,4,Banking

maiueo,"My experience was from before transitioning, but this is what I observed... 

Wall St banks are generally conservative about personal presentation and there is some variation between the companies, and between departments inside each company. JPMC is less conservative than, say, Goldman Sachs. Technical departments are more relaxed than those dealing directly with clients. Also, the HR departments are generally much more capable of assisting workers with gender identity issues than other companies. JPM Chase is highly rated by HRC and has trans-inclusive policies. http://www.hrc.org/apps/buyersguide/profile.php?orgid=599

Since you aren't out yet, I suggest playing it safe in the beginning, so you don't encounter problems with interviewers who may be biased. After you're hired you'll get to know the people in your department and HR. You can consult HR confidentially so they can assist you with coming out, etc.

Oh cute, the white privilege argument again.  Again, being white when applying to college does way more harm than good(See the SAT studies done on this, the only thing worse is being Asian).  White privilege is the victim argument of people making excuses.

Again go to any top business school and look at their finance majors.  At CMU the current finance majors come out making around 70k a year at some of the smartest companies in the world(ie Goldman, JPMC, DB, Citi, MS, Deloitte, PWC, Accenture)

To your point about stopping researching.. I didn't realize that the point of research was for it to never leave the lab.... If you are the best researcher in the world but can't transfer it into anything useful, how intelligent are you.  It is the ability to make it useful(making money off of it is a great barometer of this) that is important.

The problem with your logic is you are using a small group a people to make statements about large groups of people.  The people you listed are not a representative population of the entire population group of PHDs(again Einstein had a basic degree)  This is where your logic break happens.

How about people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin, or Larry Ellison(See I can play the name game too!, plus I would put up Gates, Jobs and Ellison up against your PHD top 3).  You know the people that actually made those inventions useful?

Have you ever worked for a company like JPMC?  No?  I have.  The culture there is pretty cut-throat.  Imagine you work on a team of 5-6 people, maybe more.  Everyone on the team is essentially pitted against each other to outperform one-another.  You outperform the others, you score the highest on your bi-annual review and you move on upward, you don't, you never do.

The stress and pressure an investment banker is under is enormous, and the higher up the foodchain they move, the more money they are responsible for...  not to mention simple mistakes, sign-offs or analysis can lose billions and cost careers.

The highest suicide rates by profession are as follows: 1. Physicians 2. Dentists 3. Veterinarians 4. *Finance Workers* 5. Chiropractors. So essentially outside of the health care profession (less nurses) financial professionals are the most likely to check out early.  It appears the age-old saying, ""Mo money mo problems"" holds true.

So I think it's a bit much to claim that there is some international conspiracy that all of these bankers are killing themselves (or being killed) for some specific reason or insider knowledge considering their status and pressure of the position, not to mention profession statistics.  If there's anything to worry about, it's that a potential market collapse is coming.

kapuasuite,"The bank holding companies, of which JPMC is one, are subject to FDIC oversight. That's a fact. I only mentioned the FDIC because it is one of many regulators who have an interest in the financial system.

As for CDO's and MBS's, I'm not sure you even know what they are. Last time I checked, the SEC has oversight over the securitization of mortgages and the issuance of those securities. An MBS is a mortgage-backed security. Basically, the income from the security is tied to the mortgage payments on the underlying mortgages. They were created to give investors exposure to the massive US housing market, and in turn increase the capital available to write mortgages. If those mortgage payments stop, the security loses value and stops generating income. When that happened in 2008, people panicked and thought that all MBS's were going to be worthless, and so there was a run on the banks as counter-parties demanded more and more collateral, assets were being sold at fire-sale prices to meet demands for customer redemptions across the board, and companies like AIG that wrote default insurance saw their losses mount.

The asset bubble grew because people thought housing was going to be valuable forever, and that they could profit off the rise. I have news for you, it wasn't the 1% taking out mortgages for a $500,000 house with an annual income of $10,000.

LOL. I've been hearing this since silver was in the 40s.

Can no one accept the possibility that silver is set in a commodity exchange, and that it's no more prone to manipulation than other commodities? The Fed is not holding down silver. The 'banksters' don't give a shit. YouTube, ZeroHedge and (insert any of the uneducated laymans) Gold &amp; Silver Daily Report are the ones that push these theories.

The manipulators ARE THE SALES MAN! Max Keiser, Kitco, Silver Doctors, etc, all want you to believe there's a large conspiracy and that you're getting a GREAT deal, but only if you BUY NOW. The conspiracy will be falling apart shortly, so be sure to buy your Max Keiser commemorative round. 

It fits perfectly into their sales narrative, so they BLAST you with their marketing and reinforce it. They'll draw some whizbang chart with lines that tells enough half-truths that would even get a semi-logical person believing what they're saying is true.

Go to fucking ZeroHedge. Turn off AdBlock. What the fuck is on the sidebars? Fucking metal ads, yo. They get a slice of those sales if you click those ads and buy.

Jasonlovestummyrub,"Think of it this way, I've been in recruiting since 2003.  At that time job boards like Monster and others were really taking off.  Companies would spend 10-15k for just one license to access the resumes in the site.

The last 2-3 years corporations have been moving to using linkedin ONLY without budgeting for job boards.   My current company does this, JPMC is moving towards it, plus other corporations I've known.  Job postings still get spent on (the monster postings you might see for a job) but recruiters generally no longer search via a job board site.  Why?  LinkedIn is free, the better recruiters have a large network built up and the candidates are generally regarded as better quality because they're usually not advertising themselves as looking (the old idea of if you're looking to leave you might have not the most positive reason for it, I.e. Just want more money, can't settle down in one company).

sfsdfd,"&gt; Even if you don't think they were a key part of the cleanup, they were at the very least important to it and helped us get out of it. 

You act as though JPMC did so out of the goodness of its heart. Do you not appreciate that these efforts were done to mitigate the gigantic liability at its doorstep, as an instrument of the worst financial disaster in the history of the world to date?

&gt; They were not the top creator of these toxic assets, and they have taken on a disproportionate amount of the responsibility. 

First: Do you mean ""disproportionate"" because Bear Sterns is not available to take the fall? That's a pretty common result of criminal punishment. If two people rob a bank and both are arrested, they share the punishment; but if two people rob a bank, and one is shot while the other is arrested, the entire punishment falls on the latter's shoulders. That's true even if the dead criminal was the mastermind.

Second: Do you mean ""disproportionate"" in terms of the size of JPMC's penalty (both government-imposed and self-imposed) vs. the profits achieved by JPMC? Perhaps you are aware that there are typically two yardsticks available for determining proportionality: the size of the profit gained by the criminal, and the harm caused by the criminal's actions. And if we use the latter yardstick in this case - devastated pensions, bankrupt homeowners, dead banks, global recession - then it's difficult to imagine *any* penalty that could be assessed to JPMC that would be *remotely* proportionate to the harm that they caused.

sfsdfd,"&gt; The vast majority of the toxic assets in question were not JPM assets according to your own source.

The document that you linked shows that the vast majority of listed assets were underwritten by Bear Sterns, which of course failed as a result - but also that a whole lot of assets listed either JPMC or WaMu as ""Lead"" and ""Co-Lead"" for underwriting. Even on loans for which they weren't even the lead underwriter, both institutions made a handy profit - right up until the bottom fell out.

I suppose your point is that JPMC wasn't the *top* purveyor of assets. That's a tired old ruse, of this form: ""Four guys rob a bank, one guy gets shot by the cops, and the other three point at the corpse and say, 'It was all HIS idea!'""

However, that wasn't my argument. I wrote above that JPMC was a key purveyor of toxic waste assets, so praising them as ""a key supporter of the cleanup"" is either badly uninformed or flat-out lying.

Jasonlovestummyrub,"This, recruiter of over a decade corporate and agency.

There are people who will gladly move into a new area for a job and SOME of those people will stay there forever.  However, the majority (and this is personal experience and employer trends proven over decades of relos) are that people who relo will likely move away again at a later date.  This is sometimes due to not thoroughly knowing the area the person moves into, missing family, family issues the employees want to move back to, or simply just being okay with traveling and it's time to move on.  Also, many companies have relo policies and they don't want to put out the 6k-10k to move someone if there's someone local around.  There's that, though to a lesser extent people also tend to like local hires due to the familiarity with the area.  People understand the travel involved to and from a job site, they're familiar with the culture.

Downside of this method of thinking is that you don't get a great deal of variation in an area due to lack of other candidates from various employers.  For example, Columbus OH where I'm at is largely populated by old Nationwide, JPMC, Cardinal Health, Limited Brands, or Hungtington Bank employees.  This is pretty much the majority of all the employees, so all the process they're familiar with, the either slow or fast pace of their employers, it all seeps into the other companies they get hired at.

My line of work in IT recruiting, I'll take what I can get.  If the manager is okay with a relo, I'm okay with a relo.  Who cares if the person stays 3 years and starts missing Tulsa, OK, at least we've progressed the project needs forward by having a person in the seat vs. searching for 6 months for someone local.

That said, the manner in which the job poster created and described the requirement wasn't very professional (IMO) almost somewhat rude..

smurfhater,"I'm a bit older (37), but have anecdote that you may find relavent.  My next door neighbor was an up and coming bigshot at Washington Mutual back in 2007.  He had a large % of his 401K contributions going into a similar company stock purchase program.  Just before the 2008 bubble a series of (in hindsight) events occurred and poor choices were made:

* he received a large (almost 6 figures as I recall) bonus which he immediately put toward equity in his mortgage (this was pre-2008 crash)
* WaMu collapsed, later consumed by JPMC by fed mandate.
* his retirement account was largely decimated, as his company stock was $0
* all of our real estate values plummeted 25% or more, but he had the added insult to injury of pissing away his entire cash bonus on the sinking mortgage
* federal regulators demanded that executives (him) repay their pre-collapse bonuses (see previous point)

So here was a dude who was earning 30% more than me, but managed to lose over $250k in equity because of the above.  I took a hit to my home equity and retirement accounts, but my checking account was untouched.  He had to settle, and still ended up owing (not exactly sure whom) over $20K.

If you really want a rewarding career in finance, advising is probably not for you.  I can confidently say that the only people who should become advisers are the ones who KNOW they want to already before they get into it. Its a huge sales job as I'm sure you're already aware and its a lot less about knowing a ton about the products that you're selling to your clients than you might think.

Most adviser shops will bring in anyone with a pulse if they know anything about finance and have something of a network they can sell to. They seduce you with telling you how once your book is setup you can basically take summers off and the work does itself for you. That's all fine and dandy but the process to get there is one that eliminates a very large percentage of those who get into the business. Bottom line, if you are not really into the idea of cold calling people every damn day, get out now. On the other hand, if you really feel passionate about becoming an adviser (which your post does not communicate in the least bit) then go for it.

For the most in-depth finance type jobs, look into getting your CFA. I work in a buy side firm and literally everyone has it. I know how crazy hard and long the testing process is but there is no better way to make it in the finance world.

No matter what you decide on any front, also look into other jobs in the field. Valuation is big. KYC/AML/BSA/Compliance in general is a lot less finance forward but you still have to know your stuff to do it, also a massively expanding field right now ([JPMC is hiring an ADDITIONAL 3K compliance personnel, HSBC also announced huge additions as well, many other institutions [broker/dealers, hedge funds, ibanks, etc.]](http://compliancex.com/compliance-lurches-from-financial-crisis-to-staffing-crisis/) are expected to be following suit in the coming months as well. You also could look into a basic analyst job. I say basic because you basically need the CFA to get most of the really good jobs.

My current company, policy is ALL resumes need to be reviewed and ""transitioned"" meaning I have to review the resume and if it seems like a good fit move forward to screen or if it's totally off, reject.

I used to work at JPMC in recruiting, there, you might get 200 resumes for a role and demand (typically) is so satisfied, that a hiring manager might only need to receive a handful of submits, maybe 3-4.  So therefore, unless the candidates coming in were in the ""must review"" class like a military vet, employee referral, or alumni, you may not need to review the resume.  The Taleo ATS would actually give icons to show you if a resume had that signifier attached to it.  So in this scenario, you might close out a req of 200 and only review maybe.. 30..

wwjd117,"&gt; If they're offering 3 billion, it has to have profited them 10-100x more.

Holder rejected their offer. 

In response, the offer was increased to $11B. Your ratio of 10-100x may have been off by an order of magnitude.

Apparently they are terrified of what could be revealed about how JPMC operates, not simply with mortgages and foreclosures, but how insanely leveraged they are, and how extensively they participate in the shadow banking system.

Their ultimate fear might be how it effects the entire banking industry, especially things that are loosely/poorly regulated (if at all).

Likely, there are jailable offences to be discovered, but corporate leadership in banking is rarely subjected to the penal system, so that probably isn't much of a concern to them.

The Treasury and Fed are chock-full of banking industry insiders, so it will be interesting how much pressure they can put on Holder to cave.

My guess is once the offer gets to $30B give or take, Holder will accept the proposal, and there will be no admission of guilt.

Again, literally not true.  If it didn't, it wouldn't have gotten massive coverage and government scrutiny.

&gt; Your understanding of market dynamics and players is flawed at best and subject to liable at worst. I know that you know nothing about this subject due to your statements about the subjects if the investment (JPMs prop desk [trades bank money and not customer money] and your mention of hedge funds [not sure where they come into this - counterparties perhaps?

The hedge funds were the ones making calls against Bruno Iksil.  Did you even *read* about the London Whale?

&gt; Further, do you really think Dimon knew of this from the start? JPM is huge, consists of multiple different branches how is one person really supposed to know what is happening on the other side of the world? I know I know ""It is his duty to monitor risk"" - his risk metrics come in the form of a one page VaR report.

Given that he denied the exposure in a conference call before it was made public and given the potential risk, yes, he knew.  What's more, it was a continuation of losses over five months - your characterization of JPMC as a massive firm should only confirm their competency.

&gt; Leveraged bets? What the hell are you talking about? Good buzzword chief its too bad leverage actually means something and you used it in an incorrect fashion.

Plowbeast,"&gt; I love these throw someone in jail for the London whale comments. The only entity that was harmed was JPM (not you, not the customer not the counterparty; JPM and only JPM). 

I'm fairly certain the investors of both JPMC and the subject of investment were more than displeased to find themselves in a short war with hedge funds.

&gt; Secondly, they filed a false report with the SEC which was not the fault of the bank as an employee sought to make this false statement. This is not a criminal offense and thus you should stop advocating for wasting the taxpayers money by attempting to throw a person in jail. 

Everyone here is saying that making a gross misrepresentation that causes a $6 billion shortfall should deserve one, not that it does now. What's more, Dimon defended and hid it before firing the trader's division manager for bad oversight - that means Chase was as liable as the employee and his manager.

&gt; Just to reiterate the London Whale debacle had no effect on you, your accounts, the overall market and market risk (but you knew that right?)

And again, yes it does.  If the loss was merely internal, no one would care one iota. The fine was punitive exactly to discourage market instability from more amateurish leverage bets.

I've worked in finance, and I probably have a more intimate knowledge of what really went on than the average layperson sitting at a computer reading Salon (or writing for Salon, for the matter)

This is deep enough down the comment thread that you're probably the only person who will read this, but I hope our conversation will be illuminating!

Anyways:

&gt;the banks who depend most on the business model they are describing were dissolved in the financial crisis

You are mistaken here. In fact, service-focused middle-market banks like Lazard and Jefferies weathered the financial crisis with no problem.

The firms that were most affected by the financial crash were the ones that strayed away from a traditional banking-services model, and possessed an over-leveraged proprietary trading operation.

&gt;To pay for the meal, they used funds provided by TARP- rather than using those funds to offset the losses in value of their own assets.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding in what TARP actually is. TARP was not a blank check worth $700 billion. TARP was about ""bailing out the banks"" as much as it was about stabilizing the price of homes on the market to keep it from plummeting further and destabilizing the economy even more.

What the governments did was buy the troubled assets from the banks, basically wiping any ""losses in value of their own assets"" off their slate. Of course, the banks got the better end of the stick, but in all honesty there was no other alternative that would have helped the American people. The government purchasing distressed assets was to keep even *more* mortgages from falling underwater. 

Anyways, what happens when a large company gets a cash infusion? Well, they expand their business--and the pickings were ripe on Wall Street in 2008. It doesn't make sense for companies to sit on $700 billion dollars and not do anything about it. 

&gt;SHAMELESS, RAMPANT AND EASILY DEMONSTRABLE FRAUD forgotten

I'm not saying that the fraud was not shameless, rampant, or easily demonstrable, because their fraud was horrible. It has not been forgotten, and it has not been forgiven. Believe me, federal prosecutors *really want to sue some people.* But the thing is, it's very difficult to trace the roots to the end of the line to see the ""real culprits"" behind the financial crisis. First of all, bankers are smart and know not to leave a paper trail. Those [who do get caught](http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2013/08/01/ex-goldmanite-fabulous-fab-tourre-takes-the-heat-as-jury-finds-him-liable-of-civil-fraud/) are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But, at the end of the day, it's quite difficult to prove wrongdoing unless it was explicitly written down. Upper-level executives can't be prosecuted and jailed because... there's no proof that they were the ones ordering the fraud. If these things happen at all, they generally happen behind closed-door meetings. 

I promise you, if there's anyone who feels the pain of letting financial criminals slip by, it's the SEC, and they haven't forgotten. They've installed financial regulators at every single big bank to make sure operations run smoothly and by-the-book. Because prosecution is largely impossible, the best that they can do is regulate, and that's what Dodd-Frank is here for. Although it's proving difficult to write (due to the complexity of the financial system), its passing is inevitable.

&gt;Because finance is complex and that shit's hard or something, that's what WSJ says anyhow.

I would assume that you don't work in finance, because the truth is that finance *is* very complex and hard, and I'm not saying that just because I'm a WSJ regurgitator. Difficult techniques like the [Black-Scholes model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes) and several different [asset pricing models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model) are only the tip of the iceberg. Banks hire hordes of very intelligent statistics, physics, and math PhD's to figure this stuff out. 

In fact, banks don't even have it that tough. The smartest, most quantitative people I know go to work in hedge funds. Although I'm not too familiar with the topic (as it's way over my head), hedge funds use concepts like [statistical arbitrage](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/AvellanedaLeeStatArb071108.pdf) among other highly complex/quantitative/difficult models to predict prices. 

&gt;Where is the equivilent of Stop-and-Frisk for Wall Street E-Mail Servers?

There is an equivalent of stop-and-frisk for Wall Street E-Mail Servers. In fact, all the SEC needs to do is get a signature-happy judge to sign off on a warrant. And honestly, with all the shit that's been going on in the financial sector lately, I'd presume that most judges would be more than willing to slap their name on any piece of paper an SEC investigator shoves under their nose. Wall Street E-Mail Servers are probed every day. Thing is, though, bankers are usually smart enough (see above) to realize that emails are incriminating, but face-to-face meetings are generally not.

&gt;The finance industry as it exists in a Tower of Babel built on bullshit

Unfortunately it's not. While over-leveraged prop trading is *definitely* very risky, the services that banks provide are not bullshit, are very real, and do contribute to the economy, believe it or not.

&gt;which if it were simply what they described it would be

After the financial crash, it largely *has been.* Investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Credit Suisse make the majority of their money by providing services to individuals and institutions. As I've mentioned above, they have scaled back their prop trading operations significantly, if not axed them altogether. Commercial banks like JPMC, BAML, and Citi have done the same.

Sorry for the long post, but I really wanted to explain the truth behind some of the matters. I'm not trying to defend the banks, because it's clear that they've defrauded Americans and there are a lot of bad people who work in those places. I just want everybody to know about and perhaps understand the complexity behind the issue. The issue is not as black-and-white as many think it is.",2013-09-12 13:03:12,cc6p4s2,5,TrueReddit

The small town and regional banks started selling heroin to the american people (houses they could not afford) the big banks saw a supply issue - these banks didnt have capital to give all this juicy heroin out, so they figured out a way to keep all the americans high by becoming the supplier (they bought the mortgages giving the banks more capital or in effect, become their 'heroin supplier'). The problem was, then americans got twice as high by doing heroin then investing in the proceeds (all those inflated returns on MBS). The banks couldnt make enough money as the money passed though them - but it was your desire to get high on a big house you can't afford that empowered it all. To say ""the bank will give me the financing, i MUST be able to afford it"" is just like thinking ""this guy says this heroin is great and ill love it, it MUST be"" - you have to recognize that everyone is out for their own best interest when it comes down to it in a capitalist society.

To add to all the big bank talk, you need to recognize that a lot of the banks that are still around and now the blunt of the criticism were the strongest banks at the time and bailed out their even more greedy peers by buying them when it would have crashed the market for them to fail. look at JPMC and BofA, they took in the weaker banks to save the system when their government called on them to. Now they have nursed those banks back to health and they are stronger than ever - who's doing was that really?

lastlucidthought,"&gt;Why on earth would JP Morgan's accounting treatment matter to you at all? You understand that bank assets could be worth more to another bank rather than to the investing public which would be buying it piecemeal, right?

Because you started into that thread by saying the assets WMB had were worthless:  

&gt;Isn't also more plausible that the sale to JP Morgan proved just how illiquid (or low in value) bank assets are? In other words the seizure and sale made the financial state of banks and the value of assets held at many banks transparent, and explicit. 

Clearly they weren't illiquid or low in value.  JPMC tried to write them down, booked negative goodwill, then wrote them up again.  The assets proved to hold as much value as WMI was pro-porting them to have.

&gt;The facially implausible claim is that the (alleged) out of priority payment of some Wamu bondholders had nothing to do with the credit crisis for the banking sector at large. 

In this case you are right.  All I have to offer is the graphs of LIBOR and TED spread that rose after Lehman's bankruptcy and spiked after WAMU's seizure.  If you're going to dismiss my evidence, I can't argue.  We'll just have to agree to disagree.

&gt; Exactly! There was no violation of absolute priority at all at any level! The liquidation happened at the bank level, except through FDIC receivership, as is normal for most bank failures and planned for by bank debtholders, rather than through bankruptcy. Claimants of the liquidated bank were paid in priority; there just wasn't enough left to pay the bank's bondholders. That the holding company had cash to satisfy its bondholders means absolutely nothing. Are you claiming that the holding company's assets should have been used to recapitalize the bank and prevent it from failing? OK, well, that's not a ""rule"" of any kind, and surely doing that would have upended people's expectations. (And thank you for conceding that the purported violation of absolute priority happened way after September 2008 - and therefore has no explanatory value with respect to the freezing of credit).
Now of course you'll say that the bank shouldn't have been liquidated because it wasn't in trouble... even though it was in the middle of a run and no one knew how much its loan portfolio was really worth... all because of this ""insolvency v. illiquidity"" distinction - more on that at the end.

The violation of absolute priority comes from splitting the bank and the bank holding company via the seizure.  One set of bonds was treated differently and had a vastly different outcome than another, depending on who issued the bonds.  

And regarding 
&gt;That the holding company had cash to satisfy its bondholders means absolutely nothing. Are you claiming that the holding company's assets should have been used to recapitalize the bank and prevent it from failing? OK, well, that's not a ""rule"" of any kind, and surely doing that would have upended people's expectations.

I'm saying that's key.  If that is true, why the seizure, WMB hadn't failed!

&gt;Buyers of debt pay attention to which corporation's debt they are buying. You're telling me that, industry-wide, investors only realized in 9/08 that a holding company's assets might not be used to satisfy a subsidiary bank's debts? Please. And if that's true, it says nothing about the absolute priority rule being violated. It just says that debt markets were very poorly informed and bank and holding company debt severely mispriced.

Banks are continually buying other companies debt.  Times and situations change.  Industry wide on October 2 2008, banks didn't trust other banks, largely because there had just been the largest seizure ever.  A seizure of a bank that had insisted that it was well capitalized.  

I know what liquidity and capital are.  As I wrote earlier, JPMC first tried to write down the value of the assets, but then had to write them back up because they weren't as bad as they originally were made out to be.  To tie it to your example, the $1M house was appraised at $1M.  If you don't have to sell, if you can wait for a $1M buyer, than it's worth $1M.  If illiquidity is the same as insolvency, and if WMI's stated $300B in assets were really worth $300B, then why did the FDIC feel the need to seize it?

And I see you're trying to pigeon hole my arguments, to better dismiss them.  You're accusing me of wanting a subsidised loan, a bailout.  No, I want you to consider that WMI would have survived on it's own, had the government not seized it.  Doing so just protected the FDIC and created the great credit crunch of 2008.",2013-06-07 04:50:44,cadlhow,1,Economics
lastlucidthought,"Calling my theories crackpot isn't going to motivate me to expend energy explaining them to you.  And if you're not going to look at my data, then you're making it impossible to convince you.  

But: Two tiers of bonds.  The ones in the bank were seized and kept with the FDIC receivership.  They were not sold to JPMC, and they're still there.  If the receivership ever ends with cash left, they'll get paid with that.  They're not getting wiped out, but they're taking about a 95% haircut.  On the other hand, bonds at the holding company are at the top of the waterfall in a bankruptcy.  They were going to get paid and did, 100% with interest.

This was obvious to the markets immediately after the seizure.  Holding company bonds went to 40% of face, bank bonds went to 15% of face.  The demonstration that absolute priority would not be followed in a seizure made everyone do a doubletake and look at their bonds.  They responded by locking up the credit markets for banks, and banks passed that lockup onto everyone else.  But don't just take my word for it:

No I doesn't.  But it does allow you to leverage the assets that you do have in order to make purchases you otherwise would not (i.e. houses, cars, boats, etc).

&gt;""Yet what many are now feeling, even with access to debt is that there is little benefit if the supply of homes is low and you are being pushed out by yield hungry Wall Street.""

Real estate is currently a very good investment.  Why should investment banks not be trading in this sector?  And the major players aren't buying houses one-by-one--they will be doing this through investment and acquisition.  The banks will look at these as future cash streams.  Furthermore, if they are spinning out investment vehicles such as REIT's or SPV's, the tax benefit could be enormous.

naked_short,"I'm not comparing Fannie/Freddie to the entire banking sector. I'm saying, that if you take the mortgage industry as a whole, fannie and Freddie were individually the largest participators. That is to say, despite the fact that their market share had dropped and Wall Street's had risen, that taken individually, they remained the largest participants. So as a hypothetical, I am saying this:

MBS issuers ranked by issuance:
* 1) Fannie Mae
* 2) Freddie Mac
* 3) Citibank
* 4) Bank of America 

So you say that Wall Street, as a whole, was securitizing one-third more loans than Fannie/Freddie. What I'm trying to point out is: Yea, sure, but Fannie and Freddie still individually dwarfed the participation of any single Wall Street bank. Which, I think is an important distinction because they really participated in the exact same activities as the Street. Why shouldn't they be treated as at least equals if not first among them? Because they had cheaper government-subsidized funding and could cherry-pick the best loans? Seems ridiculous to me. Goldman and JPMC don't get passes for managing their risk well enough to not need a bailout. And it isn't like Fannie/Freddie didn't follow Wall Street down to the bottom of the barrel in regards to subprime/alt a.

&gt;The BND works more like the Fed than anything else. The bank only has one office, in Bismarck, so it has relatively low usage for its general banking functions.

&gt;The BND is not covered under FDIC. Instead, all state and state agency funds are required to be deposited in BND accounts. In the case of a BND failure, North Dakota State funds would cover the shortage. BND also insures student loans, much like the federal government.

&gt;Ultimately, sure, if you think the Fed, or other central banks are socialism, then this certainly fits the bill. Realistically, it works as a clearinghouse for ND commerce, as it was originally intended.

&gt;I think the key to its success thus far has been the relative simplicity of its operations. It offers only minimal banking functions in only one state. Works well in ND. Scalable to a major state or the federal level, unlikely...

&gt;Because, in say a state like New York, where many of the major banks are based, the state bank would be dwarfed by the likes of BOA/ML, JPMC, UBS, Citi, etc. Really, any state with a major city, that had any finance center would be overwhelmed. The banking services current available at the BND are rather limited. While BOA charges fees BND might not, their available banking products and services are far more diverse.

&gt;The ND model may work well in relatively small states without major commerce centers. Northern New England would be a good place to look. ME, NH, or VT would all fit the bill.

&gt;An interesting state, or maybe even city government would be Michigan and Detroit, respectively. Although Detroit would require a significant capital infusion from the state for it to work fluidly, it would be interesting to see if lending services could revitalize parts of the local economy. Right now, the city is too much of a mess for many of the commercial banks to even touch.

Through his management and superior ability as an executive(which has been praised by Dear Leader Obama, mind you) and the fotress balance sheet the company constructed(they did not need the TARP funds, which they repayed easily and before any other banks, but the government forced them upon them) thanks to Dimon they were able to make it through the banking crisis stronger than ever. If not for his stellar management and ability to allocate assets and capital brilliantly the way he did then JPMC could have easily crumbled and crashed the same way the other banks did as well(many of which are still struggling and feeling the effects of shitty management). Now imagine if the biggest, most powerful, bank, THE absolute powerhouse, in America began to implode like the others there is no telling how much worse the whole crisis could have been.

Explosive_Diaeresis,"""Too big to fail"" never appeared in what I wrote, so I have no idea what you are quoting.  I personally believe if an institution is in a situation where it's failure can be catastrophic for a country, then it probably should be dismantled like the Bells.  

About your second paragraph, I think I need to complicate your view a little bit.  Lehman brothers was an investment bank, not in the same class of the money center banks like the Citi, JPMC, Wells Fargo, and B of A. Citi should have been dismantled, albeit carefully. They have been a hallmark of reckless banking and played a major part in every financial crisis since '29. JPMC and Wells didn't actually need the funds, the government forced the money into them for public appearances to prevent bank runs, but unlike IndyMac I'm not sure they were in danger of such a thing.  Wells is a particular thorny spot with me as they made money when they saved Wachovia through incredible tax breaks. BofA was a special case with them picking up Country Wide.  I think overall, we could have been more surgical in what we were doing, doing too much to help the banks out.  But I do not know personally where that line is between too much and too little.

About TARP, there were two separate programs, TARP for the banks and the program to help homeowners HARP (my last comment conflated the two, my apologies).  My stance is we should have put less resources into TARP, and more resources into HARP.  TARP did what it was supposed to do, protected banks from the full consequences of the crash, but I am not entirely sure that was the best use of resources.  Again, I'm not addressing your ""homeowners are too small"" question, because that is not a comparison I brought up.",2013-01-26 09:17:10,c83p80w,2,news

jdgrafton,"&gt;Your grades ""suddenly"" went to shit? I very much doubt that.

They only ""suddenly"" went to shit given how often I can check them. I can understand your speculating, though.

&gt;Here's my biggest piece of advice - it's never too late to turn things around for yourself, and it's not wrong to take time to focus on yourself when you're stuck in a rut.

I'm aware of that, I'm doing as much as I can to get out of this. The only problem is that I don't have a lot of options.

&gt;To be honest, your grades are probably going to suck this quarter/semester. That's ok. Everybody has rough patches. None of your future employers are going to give a fuck about your high school grades. 

That last part *seems* like a bit of relief, but I honestly doubt that. I'd rather overwork myself now and find out it didn't matter rather than blow everything off and find out I could've done better.

&gt;You should be thinking of this time in your life as practice at working really really hard. Some people figure it out early and get into a great college, BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN LIFE. I'm in a top-ranked phd program right now, and you know how many people in my year went to harvard or stanford or princeton or some such school? About 2 or 3. Out of 30. The point is, even if your current grades keep you out of, say, Harvard, they're not going to ruin your life. I went to a shitty state school. When I came out of that school I worked for JPMC for two years before grad school (made 70k/year) - and lemme tell you, JPMC did not give a shit what my high school grades were.

I'm not sure how to respond to that.

&gt;You know what will kick you in the ass later in life? If you don't take this opportunity to learn the following things. 1) Time and resource management. 

Please ignore the whole overused ""you try juggling work, school, and custody"" excuse. I'm not even going to finish that particular load of crap.

&gt;You shouldn't have to look at your grades to realize you're failing spanish. 

The teacher doesn't tell us anything when this kind of stuff happens; he hardly teaches us in the first place. Sorry if it seems like I'm trying to place the blame on someone else, but that's the way things seem to be down here. Outside of report cards, checking on my grades is the only way I find out how I'm doing at all.

&gt;If you haven't been turning in homework and you've been tanking tests that poorly, your grades shouldn't come as a surprise. 

I've checked my grades, they are turned in and everything, just very low. I have no excuses, things have just been stressful.

&gt;2) Drop this ""My school won't give me an opportunity to make up for what I did, wtf?!?!"" business. Your school owes you a decent education and that's it. They don't owe you anything beyond that - let alone opportunities to fix your own egregious past mistakes. The reason it's important to learn that lesson now? The world works the same way. The world doesn't owe you anything and it certainly won't give you anything for free.

I don't have any way to respond without sounding like I didn't read it at all. I know that one all too well, it gets drilled into my skull daily.

&gt;3) Your family has two options. They can (a) support you, or (b) suck a fat one.

Judging by how much help they've been in the past, they could do either one and I wouldn't care.

It will go away, I promise - the grief at your uncle's passing, the shame at your family's financial situation, that will all pass. What won't pass is the permanent damage you can easily do to your own life by not learning the lessons people are meant to learn in their teenage years.

Natedogg213,"**Halt the /r/politics outrage express!!**

Before you act infuriated and move onto the next sexy sounding article from blogspam sites, I ask that you do as I did and examine the issue a bit more.  I researched it a bit and (unsurprisingly) disagree with the article. To start, a good first question is:  ""Was there intent to violate the Bank Secrecy Act?""  I describe with sources JP Morgan Chase the the ""Small Fry Check Cashing Manager.

The ""Small Fry"" Check Cashing Manager:  *The name of the company is G&amp;A Check Cashing, and those charged were its manager, Karen Gasparian, and its compliance officer, Humberto Sanchez.*  So what did they do?

&gt; ‚ÄúKaren Gasparian, Humberto Sanchez and their company G&amp;A Check Cashing purposefully thwarted the Bank Secrecy Act, making it easier for others to use G&amp;A to commit illegal activity,‚Äù said Assistant Attorney General Breuer.  ‚ÄúThey knew they were required to report transactions over $10,000, but deliberately failed to do so.  As this case shows, check cashing businesses must adhere to our anti-money laundering rules, or else pay the consequences.‚Äù  

[Source](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/January/13-crm-059.html)

This manager pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to fail to file CTRs and one count of failing to have an effective anti-money laundering program.  

So, to make this clear, they **deliberately** thwarted the rule and got prison time.  I'd consider this important in discerning a difference between Dimon and them.


On to Jamie Dimon of JPMC.  The truthout article quotes another article that says:

&gt; ""Remember, it has been less than 18 months since JPMC got caught‚Äìamong other things‚Äìsending a ton of gold bullion to Iran in violation of sanctions. That time, at least, Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Asset Controls fined JPMC, if only $88.3 million.""

As the article also refers to, the Department of Treasury, Comptroller of the Currency issued a consent order a few days ago.  [Read it for yourself](http://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2013/nr-occ-2013-8.html)  It identifies ""deficiencies in its BSA/AML compliance program, and violation of the CFR regulating Suspicious Activity Report Filings.""  Some of its findings:

* The bank has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing

* The bank has less than satisfactory risk assessment processes...

* The bank has significant shortcomings in SAR decision-making protocols and an ineffective method for ensuring that referrals and alerts are properly documented, tracked and resolved.

So, this humongous bank has internal control issues on various parts of compliance with the BSA.  But is there any proof that Jamie Dimon, whose head the article asks for, was complicit and deliberately undermined the BSA?  Nope, not a shred of evidence.  There could have been a crime but it may have occurred at a much lower level.  So that brings us back to the ""small fry.""  There is a huge difference between deliberately undermining law and not having adequate internal controls across a huge organization.  

Might want to look into some of these before blindly upvoting or posting platitudinal responses...If I took one thing out of this article, it is that when banks get so big, it is much harder to identify if and who is complicit.  With that said, there is no proof that Jamie Dimon perpetrated this.",2013-01-18 04:49:44,c7yram2,29,politics

Obersts001,"Depends on the type of bank and the type of assets.  

Many of the big banks covered by the original Bernanke-managed bailout were full-service institutions with both retail and investment arms.  If, say, JP Morgan Chase went bankrupt, then Chase bank deposits would be insured up to $250k by the FDIC, and investment assets with the broker-dealer side of JPMC would be insured up to $500k by the SIPC.  However, those SIPC insurance covers only losses due to the failure of the broker-dealer, not investment losses.  So if you think of a ""bank"" as JPMC and Citi, then it's partially true, but if you're thinking of Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, their investor assets are insured exclusively through SIPC.

Keep in mind, the purpose of the bailout was to keep the entire system liquid enough to continue to do business -- failure to do so would likely have wiped out investment values, which SIPC wouldn't cover.  Second, SIPC only covers up to $500k per investor, which likely would have been a very tiny percentage of total losses in such an instance as investment assets are a lot more dollars in aggregate than everyday bank deposit accounts, albeit concentrated among a lot fewer investors.  Finally, if a large percentage of retail and investment banks went under, as could have occurred in this instance, both SIPC and FDIC would have been bankrupted themselves since they self-insure through the contributions of the member institutions and do not take government money.",2012-10-27 00:46:05,c6s4pa5,4,PoliticalDiscussion

I understand the concept of 'rules of the road'.  There needs to be a basic framework within which various subsystems operate.

But you wouldn't die from the broken skin.  You would die from sepsis/staph.

I view the monetary policy perpetrated by the Fed as the primary driver for the crisis.  The Fed has this ['wonderful' habit of 'lending' money to JPMC, BofA, Goldman, Citi, and others](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/11/fed-gave-banks-way-more-money-than-we-previously-knew.html), sometimes trillions of dollars in a single day.

If I ran a bank that received interest-free loans from my friends from the Fed network, I would lever it up some more, and pay myself a nice little bonus in the process.

Say JPMorgan Chase is in a little bit of a liquidity crunch. Consider two scenarios: 1: Fed is independent, as they are now, and the information is dispersed strictly on a need-to-know basis and 2: Fed is subject to full audits and everybody gets to see everything.

So JPMC is going through a crunch and they need liquidity. What does Fed #1 do? Easy. Give it to them. Who cares? They are in a crisis and it's easily fixed with a short term loan which they will unquestionably pay back. Now what about Fed #2? Now they see this and they have to think ""What is Congress gonna say when they see we are helping out the big evil bank?""

10thflrinsanity,"JPMC was my first position out of undergrad.  I graduated in 09 right after the collapse so there weren't exactly many high-paying investment banking positions for a finance major.  I took a job in TSS in Cincinnati, essentially moving large amounts of money from different accounts (e.g. checking one screen, entering the # into another screen) making enough to get by week to week.  I assume your last sentence is sarcasm, no?  The management at that place was some of the worst... I quit 1-year later to the week (for resume purposes).

The company's employee rating/review system is insanity, each team member, regardless of qualifications, is essentially put against one another for the highest rating of the team at review time.  My co-worker and I did about 70% of the work (we tracked this via spreadsheet) of a 5-person team.  Neither one of us got ""exceptional"" on our review, primarily because managers are only allowed to give out one exceptional.  This went to the best friend of the manager.  Bonuses are tied to review.

AyeMatey,"&gt; the FDIC would have to be dealt with by congress in the event that obligations cannot be paid.

Dealt with? 

Look, the issue is not whether the FDIC makes promises to depositors. The issue is whether the FDIC is capable of fulfilling those promises in the case of systemic failure. 

I'm saying it isn't. There is not enough money.  We know that, right?   
[Forbes magazine from November 2009: the FDIC is running out of cash.](http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/30/regional-banks-failure-intelligent-investing-fdic.html)

The abject failure of one big bank, like JPMC, would be enough to crush FDIC. 

I have no idea what  ""Dealt with by congress"" even means. Do you suppose the US Congress can conjure money from thin air?  That they could force FDIC to pay out money that FDIC does not have?  

The way Congress dealt with it in 2008 was TARP. They assessed a huge new tax on the people, in order to salvage banks.  

FDIC is not a magic bullet.

AyeMatey,"&gt; The amount, which is still relatively small, isn't that important. 

I don't agree.  JPMC declared a profit of $5.4B last quarter.  $10B is twice their quarterly profit. Therefore the rumored loss is very big. 

But it's even bigger than that straight comparison indicates. Keep in mind that liquidity is not evaluated on a quarterly basis.  If at the end of a quarter, JPMC declares a $5.4B profit, it's not as if, at some point in the middle of the quarter, they had that pile of cash available. It's accumulated profit.  On the other hand, if the bank experienced a unexpected call on its big bets, it could very quickly overwhelm whatever reserves it holds, at the moment. Conclusion: the loss is not ""relatively small"".  It was dangerously large. 

Here's the other thing - if there is a link between one big bank and the next on the same side of a bet (which is very common), you could have bank runs on both of them.  At that point there is no liquidity to save the situation.  FDIC is not large enough.  People will lose money, and we'll get  a 1907-style panic. 

&gt; What is important is that the loss is so difficult to tease out due to the shady complexity of the bank

I don't agree with this at all.  It's not ""shadily complex"".  The structure of the bets that went bad may not be clear to the person on main street, but they are not unknown to the traders on Wall St.  [It's pretty clear to people in the industry](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-21/bluemountain-said-to-help-unwind-jpmorgan-s-london-whale-trades.html).

The problem is not that the bank is ""shadily complex"".  The problem is that the bank is huge, and the risks it takes on are consequently huge, much too large to be borne by US taxpayers. 

Having a smaller bank would necessarily reduce the maximum size of the risk concentrated in one package of deals. 

This is not a conspiracy.  It's not ""a shady deal"".  It's just a huge bank, playing with money that is backed by regular taxpayers.  That's a screwy situation and it ought to be stopped.

Let the bank make its bets. But keep the taxpayer out of it. ",2012-06-29 06:22:10,c56zij9,2,news
AyeMatey,The headline is false. JPMC did not report a $9B loss.  NYTimes is suggesting that *it may do so*.  ,2012-06-29 05:59:58,c56z6la,0,Economics
AyeMatey,"If true, you can pretty much guarantee that there will be newer and stronger banking regulations coming, real soon. 

These numbers put an end to all the back-and-forth dithering about the Dodd-Frank act and the Volcker rule.  If the loss was $7B or more, there *will be* much stronger regulations. There is no more discussing that.  The only question is what will they look like? 

Dimon himself has advocated keeping things simple:  just raise the reserve limits for banks, and they'll be protected, he says. There's no need to stipulate a separation between the investing and the banking side of the business, a return to Glass-Steagall as it were, he says.  He also says this was an isolated incident.

But the problem is, JPMC was supposed to be  the best-run bank in the USA, if not the  world.   If this ""one time thing"" could happen there, it could happen anywhere.  And a slightly higher reserve, as Dimon suggests, is not going to protect the taxpayer from the blowback of those incidents.  

The bottom line issue here is not that the bank lost money.  The bank is a business, and whether a business loses or makes money is generally a matter for the investors (and other stakeholders like creditors and employees). 
The bottom line is that the bank lost money and *is backed by government insurance*, which means the US Govt is on the hook - that is to say, taxpayers are on the hook - to make good on the bank's losses, should that need arise.  

That's not a good situation.  Let the bank make big bets if it wants but I don't want US taxpayers providing the guarantees.

Tools4toys,"Good comments - but:
&gt;The creation of new companies FAR outpaces mergers in the world, especially with the massive incentives we give entrepreneurs to innovate in our patent-oriented country, and the effect that competition has on the survivability of corporations.

Can you with certainty say who owns those new companies?   Look at Enron, they created a bunch of shell corporations to hide expense and and make profits the parents profit appear larger?    Even when a new company is created, they will have to 'align' with one of the mega corporations to get business and be successful.     Mergers may be a old term, with perhaps alignments/affiliations more current.   It might even be considered negative to be associated with Corporation ABC - but they have a unwritten, I'll support you if you support me agreements.
&gt;The more powerful government gets (generally), the LESS competitive corporations become, because there are more market-skewing policies, and the market is not properly driven by competition. 

I didn't say the government was getting more powerful.   I would say my point is the government is continuing to be weakened by the corporations.    The politicians are selling away the governments strength by implementing laws and policies which favor the corporations, and this easily translates into specifically one corporation over another ( the bigger pocket wins, until the competitor steps up to a greater level of influence, yes more money).    At some point, a stalemate will arise, because no amount of money will swing a the laws and policies to favor one corporation over another.    The corporations are moving beyond a cold war to battles fought with Legal action (Oracle vs Google, Apple vs Samsung, Google vs Apple, Microsoft vs IBM- this appeared as SCO vs IBM, but the money came from Microsoft), and this will escalate to battles where a government agencies (FBI, DOJ, CIA, DOD) will be used as pawns to attempt shutdown or control of a competitor, all by laws and policies enacted or implemented.

&gt;Government since the early 1900s has been very strict about preventing companies from getting too big. 

I don't think anyone will accept this premise any longer.  What is legal now is for sale to the highest contributor.     I would agree with you about the voters continuing to elect the same bought and sold legislators year after year, but isn't this being influenced by the corporations also?   I'm not going to say with certainty that Scott Walker was re-elected simply because of the Koch brothers money, but it certainly made a difference.  

&gt;The Volcker Rule is a pretty brutally strict piece of legislation that curbs a lot of the proprietary trading these firms used to participate in.

I would say the rule is strict, but clearly JPMC had to be aware of this before performing the $2B trading losses from derivatives in May.    Or was this just that last gasp attempt at glory and riches before the law takes affect in July?     Of course, read the Wikipedia article you cited, this is a quote from that article - 
&gt;Since the passage of the Financial Reform Bill, many banks and financial firms have indicated that they don't expect The Volcker Rule to have a significant impact on their profits.

Clearly not a factor at JPMC!

&gt;Also, I just wanted to add that big corporations competing is a F***ING GOOD THING, because it changes the focus from pure profit-seeking to actually appealing to the consumers, since people are going to buy the good that provides the most utility for its value, and prices will go down as a result.

I would agree - and could cite the products driven by Apple as a example of creating profit through innovative and functional products.    However, if competing corporations can't design the better product, they'll fight with legal tools, changes in laws for taxes on imported items from a specific country, etc.  They're more creative than I am in that regard, but the point is they aren't making better products, just attempting to limit the strength of Apple.    The Apple products have weakness that can and are being exploited, but in many ways that isn't the sole means of competition any longer.

The other difference from 2007 is that this loss isn't that ""big"" in proportion to the economy. Remember, in 2007 the sweater unraveled because banks were trading risk with counterparties that were in danger of being wiped out because they had assumed more risk than the entire company could fund.

I really do not think this is such a big deal.

You might ask, ""Are you crazy or just unaware that $5 billion is a lot of money?"" But there are good reasons why I think this is a temporary setback.

Firstly, ""rogue traders"" are common. These cowboys cut corners and exceed limits with either explicit signoff or a wink &amp; nod because they are [making money](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/london_whale_made_millions_on_risky_lYUS7mno4Mc7LIwEt6CqDL). When they lose money, they are suddenly rebranded ""rogue traders"" who cut corners and exceed limits.

Second, this is not abnormal. Remember [IBM lost $5 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/20/business/ibm-posts-5.46-billion-loss-for-4th-quarter-1992-s-deficit-biggest-us-business.html) and [GM lost $23.5 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/12/business/company-reports-gm-lost-23.5-billion-last-year.html) in the same year? Remember [Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale lost 4.9 billion Euros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2008_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale_trading_loss_incident) unwinding a ""rogue"" FX position? These are big numbers to little people, but chump change to the corporate titans. JPMC recently turned a profit that was about the same size as this *potential* loss.

Finally, this is not unexpected. I understand that the trader was speculating with a type of financial instrument based on the risk that a company will default on a loan. To be more precise, instead of selling off the risk from the bank's loan portfolio to lock in profits even if the borrower defaults, he was engaged in trading risk for profit by buying and selling Credit Default Swaps in the market.

Realistically, the biggest long-term risk for JPMC is that they will be barred from speculative trading. Considering that our mortgages and checking accounts are being used to fund Wall Street gambling, it might be a good idea to put back some of the Glass-Steagall controls.

That being said, if JPMC were a nuclear superpower, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists would move the [Doomsday Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock) another minute closer to midnight.",2012-05-21 14:52:26,c4qgycj,3,collapse

Their risk is fake, because it is your risk (unless you just don't pay taxes on principle). if you can't get that, all hope for you is lost.

P.S. WellsFargo and JPMC were given (or as you say ""forced to take"") money by the guvmint to buy out the failed firms.

In this case, they claim that it's their hedging strategy that lost them $3 gigabucks.

The last 30 years of deregulation have left big banks with very little oversight or rules (by historical standards).  In this instance, JPMC can absorb the loss, but the fact that they incurred the loss is evidence that their risk management isn't so great.

This particular $3 gigabux is the canary in the coal mine.  It's not the problem, but it foretells bigger problems to come.

So where are your sources and citations that JPMC didn't need the bailout and didn't pay it back? Others have provided numerous sources that back up what actually happened. They took the bailout and were forced to, and paid it back over 6 months. A lot of banks were like this. Wells Fargo was another one, they told the government they didn't need or want the bailout and that it would make them look bad. Didn't matter, the government forced the bailout on Wells Fargo, and just like JPMC, Wells Fargo paid it back within a month. Ford also wanted no part of the auto bailouts, but was forced to take one as well, and paid it back almost immediately.

1) I have no objection to *States* engaging in welfare, public education, unemployment, and so forth.  They Federal government is not entitled to do so.  It's only job is to keep us free (and run the Post Office).

2) I made far more than min wage in college for one simple reason:  Since I did not have much access to TV growing up, I found ways to entertain myself.  I ended up with a skill set that enabled me to find better-than-average work in college (as well as a lot of crappy work).  That combined with *private* scholarship money made it possible to graduate without debt and without the use of Other People's Money.

3) $900/mo is not extravagant, that is true.  But that's not the issue.  The issue i... *it is NOT their money*.  Why is someone else more entited  to my time (which is all money represents) than my own family?

4) We can go back and forth on who has paid more  in taxes, but I've had the distinct pleasure of paying taxes on money I had not yet even earned.  It's a side effect of how taxation of stock options as a form of compensation work.   It's pretty bad when you're taxed on money you don't even have.  But then, someone has to fund the utopian wetdreams of the Saviors Of Mankind.

5) The way to stop pollution of resources is to make them PRIVATELY owned and subject to severe civil tort remedies if the pollution leaks onto someone else's property.  As a group, regulators are dolts with the EPA being the worst of the bunch.  Real fiscal pain ... especially if it is also declared to be criminal negligence wherein we could go after the individials running the polluting companies ... would be far, far better than the political trash that occupies the EPA et al.

6) I never said I didn't benefit from government spending and I am happy to pay taxes that benefit everyone equally (like roads and so forth).   I object to having to pay taxes so that the money can be directly handed out to other people as a form of buying votes.

[deleted],"&gt; The cost of life is already higher than when minimum wage was established. 

That is simply not true.  The cost of *living the way you'd like to* is high.  But people can form all kinds of other communal living arrangements to get through tough times ... and they do that when they HAVE to.  

I grew up quite poor.  It's why I have so little patience for all this.  If you live among the putative poor - my family was an exception - you see tons of sexual irresponsibility, substance abuse, and a general failure to be responsible.  There are exceptions but they prove the rule.  If you pulled the plug on this stuff you would see people making such arrangements and you would see innovation as people found creative ways to create microbusiness, enter into bartering arrangements, and generally find ways to cope.   Moreover, those of us well employed, would be able to direct even more money to charity than we already do.

The gummint, of course NEVER wants this to happen.  For the Obamas of the world (and there are many), the worst thing that could possibly happen would be for people to discover that they do not NEED the government.  Even worse, if individuals get to decide where their charitable monies go, the government won't be able to prop up the malignant sluggards both at the top and bottom of the economic system because NONE of us really wants to help either the stupid banker OR the crackwhore.

&gt; Possibly, but one small example of big government failing

That's a pretty rosie view of what is before us.  Two big government presidents together TRIPLED the national debt in about 11 years.   Obama alone is good for 1/3 of the total debt.  That translates into a crushing anti-employment environment as the dollar steadily looses value.

&gt; how do you explain away the fact that a majority of top economists believe that the bailout did more good than harm 

These are the same economists that completely missed the gathering storm in the prior years.  These are the same Keynesians that keep proposing tired old dogma that does not work in the face of market solutions that do work.   These are the same eocnomists that have flatly been MIA for most of this and suddenly devided that bailing out Bear Stearns et all was a GREAT idea.  Just watch, the Idiot Administration is going to find a way to help JPMC avoid feeling the sting of their own stupidity.

&gt; Seems as if you might be a bit biased.

Yes because I cannot abide power hungry, monomaniacal political ooze and the swine that follows it.  I didn't agree with Bush on many matters, but he seemed to start every speech with ""We"", ""The American People"", or ""The United States"".  Obama starts nearly everything with ""Me, Myself, and I"".  He's a political pig of the worst kind.  No surprise, given the rock from under which he slithered. (I live near Chicago and have seen the ooze first hand.)

&gt; I'm vehemently against a completely free market with no regulation or ""help"".

I am vehemently against paying for people's failure.  I AM for government interdiction in matters of fraud or force, but that's it.

&gt; ree market ideals in general hinge upon an educated and enlightened public

True, but only half the story.   These ideals also strongly INCENT people to become educated because - without Mommy Government around to wipe their bottoms - they quickly learn the cost of not doing so.

&gt; People are cheap and greedy.

There's nothing wrong with this as a matter of public behavior so long as their actions do not involve fraud, force, or threat, all three of which the government should smack down.

&gt; We want to make the most money we can while simultaneously spending the least.

Yes and it's the best possible instinct we could have.  Doing this causes nothing but innovation and increased quality of life.  That's why mainframe computers used to cost millions and were available only to the wealthiest corporations, but now everyone can own an iPad which is considerably more powerful.

[deleted],"Refining margins are small.

I will just repost what some FlyerTalk users have said about this deal.


azeckel

&gt; Didn't actually click on the links, but assuming it's not an April Fool's day thing - this would be a monumentally terrible idea. Vertical integration only works when you can recognize efficiencies between two units - something that oil refining and air travel would not be able to do. So even if DL could consume jet fuel at cost, they would be sacrificing profits from one division for the benefit of another - a zero sum game. Even the MBA's down there in ATL must realize that...
&gt; ...
&gt; It shouldn't matter at all. If DL buys a refinery, that refinery becomes part of its operations and costs and revenues from it flow directly to the income statement. If the spread is really high, then DL would essentially suck profits out of the refining division to subsidize the airline. They would achieve the same financial results as selling jet fuel on the open market from the refinery and buying it at the same rate for the airline. The ONLY way it makes sense is if there is some synergy that would allow them to operate the refinery more efficiently than others in the market, thereby increasing their ""crack spread"". To me, I just don't see how operating an airline qualifies anyone to run a refinery.


JC1120

&gt; Being in the industry, this is a REALLY REALLY bad idea. Refining margins are next to nill. They'd not only need to figure out how to run the refinery as efficiently as possible, which is hard enough for a refining company like Valero, but for execs that barely know how to run their own airline, how are they going to be counted on to run this business properly?
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, this is an old refinery. They would have to deal with the environmental nightmares of upgrading/running one of these things in the northeast. And, when this venture inevitably fails, good luck finding someone to unload it to. Delta will then get stuck with the environmental liability and the lawsuits that are come with the territory. Oil companies won't permanently shut down refineries in many places even though they're old and outdated because doing so would require them to dismantle and clean-up their toxic sites at costs Delta can't even begin to imagine paying for. This could be precisely the reason JPMC won't buy the darn thing themselves.



Wan1dap

&gt; Refineries don't produce crude oil - it's the feedstock they use to produce finished products, like Jet A-1, diesel, gasoline etc. I struggle to see this as a good deal. There's a reason so many refineries are for sale; they're uneconomical. Delta won't see any lower prices for fuel; how could shareholders allow the LLC to sell at less than market price? And the swops with BP will obviously be at market. The only (tiny) benefit will be some margin capture in the LLC. Hardly sufficient reward for the headache of buying, upgrading and running a refinery. Difficult to see any logic in it. ConocoPhillips will be smirking all the way to the bank.



DLdweeb

&gt; The problem is, that logic ignores the real cost of providing your own fuel. Suppose the price of jet fuel on the open market skyrockets so much that many Delta flights would be unprofitable. But now Delta can fly those flights using their own internal fuel! -- except the ""refinery division"" loses by not being able to sell that expensive fuel on the open market. 
&gt;
&gt; The real cost is what the company is giving up to use the fuel itself: the price it would command in the market (markup included). If Delta sacrifices refinery profits to fuel their flights, those costs are just as real as out-of-pocket expenditures.",2012-05-02 03:34:26,c4iuj11,1,business

gtny,"Don't confuse the defendant's cost of coming into trial with the costs of running the actual court system. This includes time for witnesses to appear, costs to find/subpoena them (some SCCs charge the plaintiff the same cost per witness as they do for bringing defendants). Your original claim was about cases filling the court system and pushing additional costs on tax payers. This is not the case because the system exists and is funded/budgeted to a certain capacity. If someone is running around committing crimes so the District Attorneys and Public Defenders have to come in and work cases then yes, the more cases brought to court will incur much more time, money and work into the system that the public will have pay for (but they can still only try so many cases/day). In a civil case like this, the only additional costs are incurred by the individuals or corporations involved. The burden of seeing additional cases past it's capacity is not placed on the public, rather it's pushed further back on the docket to be seen when time allows for it. Of course seeing 20 cases will cost more than 10 cases. But if they can only see 100 cases/week/judge and they have more cases than that, the excess will simply going to eat into the allowance for the next week and the costs for running the court for that week will be the same as any other week that hits capacity. They try very hard to budget and stay within it. SCCs usually have very stripped down proceedings to expedite many cases quickly without the hang-ups of full on trials. They're designed to not need lawyers and in some places, only self representation is allowed. 

OP already has paid the court costs to bring his case forward in the first place (it's the first step in actually filing a claim). He has also filed claim for both the damages and for the court fees should he win in court. He has already shown that he is willing to put those costs forward and has a chance of recouping them afterward. Yes the courts want people to work out their own problems but when they have no other recourse, that's the whole reason why they're in court in the first place. That's why there's the option to settle and in most cases the option (or contractual obligation depending on the parties and terms involved) to go to arbitration instead of appearing before a judge. What the courts want and are legally obligated to do as part of the law and their jobs can differ but the latter will always win out. 

If you're worried about JPMC or any other defendant losing their money on legal fees, maybe they shouldn't have broken their contract, injured the plaintiff or damaged their property. If they feel the claim is unfair and plaintiff wouldn't take the settlement, they can make their stand in court. If OP had sued me and I lost, he must have been able to fulfill the burden of proof for his claim. If I had a law firm on a multi-million dollar retainer doing nothing then yes, I would have them come in to see if they can swing things my way. But if the costs of the damages is less than the cost of the lawyers, why would I possibly want to spend more money hiring them? The amount they're suing for is know when they serve me, it just can't change without notice. If I hire lawyers for whatever reason, I better be sure to pay them unless I want to come back to court for breach of contract for non-payment.

And yet, super-whiner Jamie Dimon and his JPMC spent more than a total of $13 million (Yr2009 &amp; 2010) lobbying Congress on the Dodd-Frank bill. Another $3.3 million from Mr. Dimon's bank was ploughed onto lobbying the regulatory agencies as late as August of 2011. Hence, *the whole Dodd-Frank bill was still a work-in-progress*. EDIT : Typo

The much anticipated *Volcker-Rule* has yet to kick-in until this coming July and this NYMag article was talking too fast too soon - as if the establishment of Dodd-Frank was already cast in stone (the bill's other elements are still being phased in between now and up till 2016) ...and that *the Master of the Universe are master no longer*?!

it's actually very simple, but a pain in the ass to figure out.  the basic formula is this:

a) gradually increase the measures by which governments can destroy the competition to the corporations that pay them off

b) make people believe it's good (blame DEregulation for the disasters, increased market share, profit hoarding, etc., caused by gov't monopolization)

c) go to step a

so you are right that people don't buy anything from corporations because of this.  however this is not the fundamental problem - there is a specific group of people becoming rich into the TRILLIONS because of this system.  and as long as people keep going on with this Koch Brothers bullshit and ignore the financial cartels, well, i don't need to tell you what will happen, because it's been happening for the last century.

hint hint: the Great Depression?  caused by a bubble resulting from **The Federal Reserve** printing money and causing a period of massive malinvestment.  who benefited the most when the system collapsed?

who benefited the most from the bailouts?

who benefited the most from WWII?

there's one answer to all three questions.  Rothschild family, and their underlings, Rockefellers, Morgans, Kuhn/Loebs, Schiffs, whatever.  and one stunning fact that this PDF will reveal...

is how tightly associated those families were with the **Roosevelt** administration.

haven't enough people died already?  how long will authors like Caleb Crain here keep selling the myth that pouring money taken from farmers, teachers, into WAR is somehow NOT destructive?

Great Depression history is one of these huge ambiguities in American culture.  nobody understands what happened, they prefer to go with these simple explanations, like, the Smoot-Hawley tariff act, or, not even bothering to cite something specific, ""deregulation.""

no, the problem was that the 13-year-old Federal Reserve system had poured so much taxpayer money into banks:

What? Hedge Funds still have to comply with law, if they acted solely as a hedge that's one thing, but it is clear they didn't feeling their title as ""Hedge Fund"" protected them regardless of their actions. So, no, the situation is NOT all that different.

&gt; Remember, I-banks are market makers and if they took on the role of market making, that can be separate from financial advisory.

Still, they have to be honest about the products they are selling: anything less is outright fraud. Much like there are lemon laws for car dealerships, there are disclosure laws for investment services.

&gt; Most of the deals were in conjunction with Investment banks (i.e. JPMC, DB, etc.).

Yes. But they went outside their purview in many of the specific deals.

&gt;The only type of regulation would be some new style of capital reserve calculation, based upon not only direct loans, but total risk in the marketplace. It would take an army to figure it out, hence, nothing has changed since 2008.

Or, the old style of capital reserve calculation where banks and others had to have their assets and liabilities actually verified instead of being essentially ""made up"" for SEC disclosures with multiple books being kept. If you read through my posts, I really hate the idea of M2M accounting because it hid a lot of the problems from investors, buyers, regulators, clients, etc etc.

&gt; They are not exchange-traded for a reason. There is no uniformity in the contracts.

They were utilized (away from the original and fairly narrow purpose) because investment insurance was illegal, but it performed the same role. I don't care if there is uniformity or not, having something that opaque that could manipulate the appearance of the soundness of those institutions is a huge power play by managers away from investors and the market at large. Either don't count them as assets to leverage against or make the parties and terms public. We're not talking about small firms where the primary investors are small in number and well informed, thus disclosure is important to make good ""rational"" decisions.

&gt; Yawn. The SEC employees are too busy watching porn to care about regulation and justice. I guarantee you Magnetar is not worried.

The SEC was bullied into not policing the system for nearly 5 years before the crash. Now that they have been empowered by the last Congress morale picked up a little bit.

&gt; I suggest you read the book Fool's Gold about JP Morgan's development of BISTRO-style securities. They were the kings of CDOs and CDSs in the mid-to-late 90s, though Banker's Trust and Salomon Bros. were some of the first to do a deal.

I'm aware, but even corporate debt was becoming so complex that no one really had a grip on it by the time of the crash. The reason why we are talking about housing is because more people understand it vis-a-vis corporate debt, it had more of what could be called a viable aspect, and it went first.",2011-06-28 01:22:59,c226yvf,0,Economics

Zero documentation or proof has been released showing violation of contractual obligations to these clients.

Remember, I-banks are market makers and if they took on the role of market making, that can be separate from financial advisory.

&gt;The purpose of Hedge Funds is just that, to hedge against losses of another party. But since their inception they have expanded their role, acting more like investment banks instead without the supposed ""rules"" that hampered said investment banks. As well, many Hedge Funds got dangerously close to other forms of illegality: cornering markets, selling products they had no business in selling.

Most of the deals were in conjunction with Investment banks (i.e. JPMC, DB, etc.).

&gt;""Some bankers involved in the Magnetar Trade now regret what they did. We showed one of the many people fired as a result of the CDO collapse a list of unusually risky mortgage bonds included in a Magnetar deal he had worked on. The deal was a disaster. He shook his head at being reminded of the details and said: ""After looking at this, I deserved to lose my job."" ""

Again, he's telling the author what they want to hear. Not to mention, he is probably one of the people that lost on his trade, hence why he got fired. Not every single deal winds up huge making money. 

&gt;They absolutely likely will be regulated. That's another story. To the point there is an instrument that CDS' as they were used was supposed to do: insurance. What they ended up being were bet making apparatuses, alongside being a loophole that got around the illegality and/or regulation of investment insurance. And the regulatory mechanism that WAS bound to control the market was shut down over political reasons.

The only type of regulation would be some new style of capital reserve calculation, based upon not only direct loans, but total risk in the marketplace. It would take an army to figure it out, hence, nothing has changed since 2008.

&gt;But, why should CDSs have immunity to the prying eyes of the general market?

They are not exchange-traded for a reason. There is no uniformity in the contracts. Each swap is customized, the same as an interest rate swap contract. They are agreed upon by two parties and if one is unable to pay at the end, the other party is screwed.

This would have happened to numerous I-banks if AIG didn't get bailed out.

&gt;No. The profits from the CDOs succeeding was secondary. They were betting against their own instruments that they were advertising as good investments to the best of their knowledge. On top of that they weren't even supposed to be picking the products they were buying. That's what the whole article was about.

Read the article again.  Magnetar stood to make bank either way. When you take on the riskiest tranche of MBS, you are going to make money. The bonds were paying a hefty payment and are purchased at an extreme discount because of the risk. That is the reason they used derivatives instead of directly trading the asset. 

&gt;Shockingly, I have no real issue with the idea of banking. It can be very useful, and if the proper eyes and batons are ready can do wonders easing boom and busts. As for illegality, the SEC is investigating and may possibly find culpability.

Yawn. The SEC employees are too busy watching porn to care about regulation and justice. I guarantee you Magnetar is not worried.

&gt;Consumer mortgages? Doesn't really seem so. Most of the housing boom was speculation. Over-investment and under consumption, with resources not being aligned with demand.

&gt;Consumer debt and falling wages just made it so that train couldn't keep pace of affording ever increasing homes. And all of the complex instruments in concert amplified the issues in the primary economy, both consumer and ground level commercial.

I suggest you read the book Fool's Gold about JP Morgan's development of BISTRO-style securities. They were the kings of CDOs and CDSs in the mid-to-late 90s, though Banker's Trust and Salomon Bros. were some of the first to do a deal.

CDOs and CDSs started off based upon corporate debt, which is far less risky and more understood. JP Morgan originally balked at the idea of using mortgages because of two reasons:

1) The housing market hadn't seen a significant downturn since the 30s, unlike other markets

2) Because of the lack of data, they were unable to effectively model the risk

They only jumped on board because of client demand and other banks were raking in big fees for years. Once they merged with Chase, there was a big shakeup in management and philosophy. ",2011-06-27 20:33:33,c225c11,1,Economics

I've worked for several fortune 100 companies and jpmc is easily the most hostile and ass backwards place I've ever had the misfortune of being employed at.  True story incoming.

One friday my ex got off work early (from JPMC, remember..?) and we went to a JPMC branch to deposit CASH.  It was about 3pm or so.  The teller ended up giving us some crazy attitude.  We complained to the manager.  My ex was still in her work clothes, JPMC badge and everything.  If this is how you treat fellow employees god only knows how you're treating regular customers.

Sat night rolls around and we're about to go to my moms house, we decide to check the account first.  The account is in the NEGATIVE, by a lot.  The teller put a hold on the CASH deposit because she was a bitch.  We had over draft fees from hell.  We called their help desk and no one would/could help us.  Even talked to a supervisor.  Every JPMC employee has an employee ID.  The supervisor straight up told us she had no employee id.

This call went on for hours.  They would not believe that we had deposited CASH.  We had the receipts and everything.  No matter what we said they would not reverse the course of action that led to us being hundreds of dollars in the negative.  Those overdraft fees essentially wiped out ALL of the cash we had deposited (once it actually hit that is).  We both felt ill.

These are extraordinarily complex topics that people can (and do) spend a lifetime studying and still disagree about.  My impression is that these documentaries present simplistic arguments and try to appeal to gut reactions.  They may be useful for people unfamiliar with the mechanics of the economy, but what I'd love to see is a documentary that presents multiple schools of thought simultaneously, and compares their methodologies and conclusions on various topics.  It also seems like it'd be useful for documentaries to talk about how the modern markets work.  Even in this short testimony, there was a lot of financial terminology that I don't imagine many people are familiar with.  If someone is not familiar with the concepts of treasuries, agencies, primary dealers, etc. I can see them coming away from this Grayson video thinking that Mr. Alvarez is a stammering idiot and is trying to cover up some sort of impropriety between the Fed and JPMC, when in reality he was just flabbergasted by the vagueness and absurdity of Grayson's questions.

""Who got the money?""

""So the most of the increase in our balance sheet has been the purchase of US government securities and the purchase of agency guaranteed securities in the open market, from market participants broadly.""

What does that mean in layman's terms?  It means at some point in the past, the US Treasury borrowed money by selling bonds (like the $50 savings bond your grandmother gave you for your birthday, though the Fed is typically going to be dealing with much larger denominations), adding to the national debt, so that it could pay for the military, highways, etc. and then the Fed bought those bonds back from whoever bought them.  They also loaned money to agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so some of the money ended up going toward mortgages, student loans, etc.  If you can parse Alvarez's answer, you'll realize that essentially what he's saying is that most of the money effectively went to the US government, not to places like the ""Dick Cheney Savings &amp; Loan"", as Grayson put it.

This hearing would have been far more effective for the ""audit the fed"" crowd if Grayson had cut all the crap about the standard open market operations and primary dealers (like Mr. Alvarez, I have no idea what he was even trying to allude to with that) and instead focused the questions on the smaller, but potentially more risky operations involving non-government securities, loan facilities, etc which there may actually be value in auditing.

LibertarianAtheist,"What you have failed to mention is the impact of ""printing money"" and like most Keynesians, the fact that ruining the purchasing power of the poor and working class means little to the ideology. The perpetuation of trickle down economics is the core of Keynes theories, visa-vi creating more fiat currency and distributing it to favored institutions (AIG, CITI, JPMC, Wells Fargo, etc.) who in turn, distribute the dollars to the rest of us at a profit, not to mention the KBRs and Blackwaters that also benefit from freshly created currency. This concept also includes the ability for the Federal Government to continually spend money on failed socialist programs (SS, Medicare/caid, Wellfare, the VA, Dept of Education, etc.) that they cannot borrow or tax by requesting the Fed to print or ""move"" money into the Treasuries coffers.

Your misinformed view of government power is a no coincidence, as the American form of economics is Keynes or nothing, for you will not learn about free markets (free of government intervention) in school, college, or graduate school. Very few educational institutions are even subject to the free market, as most benefit off of the Keynesian system, further adding fuel to the false argument that a secret group of unaccountable individuals gets to decide who succeeds and who fails based on where they allocate money is the only way to make things fair.

It's circular logic and in my opinion, an outright acceptance of corruption.

War spending is NEVER good an economy on either side. It is not individuals producing something for a profit, no, it is individuals forced to produce what the government demands at a loss to us all. Those dollars that they spend from taxes run out quickly, as there is not enough to sustain the wanton spending of government, so they just increase the money supply, which devalues the dollars already held, earned, and saved by the average citizen. 

Furthermore, every bomb built, every base constructed, is an allocation of resources taken from a community that could have spent that money locally, thereby generating an income for more and more people. What WWII did in terms of economic damage is almost unfathomable, as you stated, 10 Trillion dollars worth of pure loss, not to mention the draft and countless numbers of deaths and wounded soldiers who, in a time of peace, could have been generating an income without the need to destroy the value of their dollar.

Hell, we haven't even payed off the Spanish-American War, let alone WW1, WW2, Korea or Vietnam. That's not even counting the current wars we are fighting. 

As Ron Paul has stated many times, if you borrow a million dollars a month, it sure would seem like everything is going fine, till it comes time to pay up. That time is now, and we have less than a cent to our collective name. Keynes solution is to just print more money and never EVER pay anything back. If you follow M3 reports (unofficial, as the Fed has become more secret as time goes by) you would see that just in the last year, the Fed has increased our money supply by over 100%.

LWRellim,"Bullshit... The article is pretending Black said something he DIDN'T say -- and creating a non-sequitor [or arguably a ""strawman""].

Black claimed that the FDIC could ""seize"" (indeed is required to) any of the BANKS that are insolvent (which is true).

The DKos idiot is them extending that and claiming that the FDIC has no power to sieze the bank holding companies (which is also true, but a non-issue).

The FDIC can seize the BANKING side of those holding companies -- and leave them with whatever remains (as it did last fall when it seized the banking operation of WaMu and ""gifted"" the whole works to JPMorganChase [done, IMO, not because WaMu was truly insolvent, but because JPMC was and it was a quick way of bailing them out]).

antifacist,"JP Morgan Chase is at the heart of the derivatives mess. The ""Morgan Mafia"" created derivatives in the first place. It holds something like $90 trillion in derivatives which is about half of the total amount held by US banks.  This is according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which is a branch of the US Treasury Dept. For comparison the US GDP in 2008 was about $14 trillion and the world GDP for the same year was around $78 trillion.

I'm guessing JP Morgan Chase is what Geithner is talking about when he refers to ""some banks"" that will need ""large amounts"" [tens of trillions] of assistance.

shaunc,"&gt;The house wasn't trashed, they just didn't really bother to clear everything out.

This is fairly common, and in fact, nowadays many lenders are actually offering residents a cash bonus to move out of the house. It's essentially a bribe - we'll give you a few grand, you use that to go rent somewhere to live, and in turn, you don't wreck the house on your way out.

I work in the industry and we have an REO (bank-owned/foreclosure) department, so I've heard horror stories in terms of wrecked homes. Appliances ripped out, feces smeared across the walls, pets abandoned to die and rot, you name it. Understandably, folks don't like being foreclosed upon, and they often will take it out on the property because they feel that's their only recourse against the bank.

Lenders have wised up and discovered that it's cheaper to pay the delinquent residents to move out peacefully. Of course, there are the cases where the residents simply won't leave, even after being offered cash. Even after repeated notices. And that's where the ""cleanup crews"" like those mentioned in the article come into play.

[deleted],"Have you even bothered to read what a Non-Recourse Debt is? Obviously, you have not. Liability is not really at issue here, except that you've made it such. The argument, per the title of this entire thread, is whether this is a ""free ride"" or not. It is not.

From the Wikipedia Article:
&gt; Nonrecourse debt or non-recourse debt or nonrecourse loan is a secured loan (debt) that is secured by a pledge of collateral, typically real property, but for which the borrower is not personally liable. If the borrower defaults, the lender/issuer can seize the collateral, but the lender's recovery is limited to the collateral.

You are correct in one respect; the lender (the Fed) is not holding JPMC personally (or corporately) liable for the default. But that does not mean it is a ""free ride."" JPMC had to put up collateral for the loan, and JPMC _will lose that collateral_ if they default. Therefore, JPMC actually _does_ have a liability on their books for this. As also from the wiki:

&gt; Non-recourse debt is usually carried on a company's balance sheet as a liability, and the collateral is carried as an asset.

As of today, March 18, 2008, JPMC has matching assets and liabilities on the books for this loan, which wash (which is common for any loan. ever. under any circumstances). Should they default, the liability goes away, and the Fed confiscates the assets and auctions them off. We don't know what assets were put up to secure this transaction, but the safe bet is on BSC's physical assets, such as their office buildings, etc. JPMC _will lose these assets_ if they default.

The only thing special about this loan, in any way, is what the Fed can do if the Assets don't entirely pay off the loan balance; in that case, the Fed simply _eats the difference._

At this point in time, there's absolutely no way to gauge how likely a Default is, nor what assets were put up, nor how much they will be worth at the time of Default (_if_ that happens).

But JPMC, while not ""legally liable,"" does have liability exposure here - the assets they put up to secure the loan.",2008-03-19 02:46:14,c03h7ep,1,reddit.com
[deleted],"No? Really? That's funny. Every source I can find specifically calls them ""nonrecourse loans"".

&gt; The Fed is making a $30 billion non-recourse loan to JPMorgan against Bear's mortgage-related assets.

http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/03/16/jpmorgan-chase-to-get-1-billion-in-additional-profit-from-bear/

See also multiples of reports on CNN, FoxNews, the BBC, and so on. See also JPMorgan Chase's own Press Release, and any statements on the matter from the Fed.

All of them, every one, calls it a ""non-recourse loan.""

Let's be clear here; it's a secured loan. The difference between this and other loans is that it's possible (even likely) that the assets will not cover the entire principle, but it is not a ""free ride"" by any stretch. If JPMC or whatever subsidiary is technically liable defaults, they lose those secured assets. This is what is meant when they say that the Fed is assuming some liability here; the Fed and JPMC are basically sharing the liability, they're covering each other to some extent. If JPMC pulls it off and pays back the loan in full, then no blood no foul; if they default, they only lose the assets they put up as collateral (my bet would be that this is BSC's assets, which would mean that this is a null-game for them if they fail; they neither gain nor lose anything for the effort), and the Fed can mitigate their losses by auctioning off the Secured Assets.

Unless, of course, you have a specific source citing that this is some sort of magical Nonrecourse loan that hasn't existed before now.

This is how it works. I've now provided sources showing exactly what a ""non-recourse loan or debt"" is, as well as showing a number of sources showing that this situation is, indeed, a ""non-recourse loan or debt.""
