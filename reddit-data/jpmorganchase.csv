mrmike009,"Here's the the thing Joey, you can certainly go down to your local Subaru store and try to get a new lease.  Is your lease through Subaru (JPMorganChase)?   If so, it might be easier than you think to get out of the lease and into a new Subaru.  There is a current buy out that is good for 15 days on your vehicle.  If said buyout is lower than the trade-in value...you have equity for trade.  If its even...its a wash.  If its lower than the current buy out...you are in negative equity.   Subarus tend to hold value pretty well....so you'll probably be either in a wash or slightly negative...which is not bad.   

&amp;#x200B;

Value of your Legacy is dependent on trim, condition, miles and area you're located as well as auctions (mannheim for instance).    If you want to do this, do it now because the 2020 Legacys are a full model redo and will make your Legacy go down in value further, faster, should you wait until then.

csingel,"""believe in it so heavily"" is a bit of a stretch, but to give you some background, I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2011ish, interviewed with Coinbase and JPMorganChase where they said ""wow, you really know your stuff.""

All that to say, I got into it because the nerds were excited. I didn't know what the byzantine generals problem was or why it mattered, I really knew quite little about the economy and velocity of money, but people smarter than me were very excited about it and could explain it passionately. Seeing Andreas Antonopoulos speak live in part for him, but in part for the naive questions of the audience. We were very early then (2014ish?) and are still early now.

I've elucidated some of the problems Bitcoin can help improve, and these are major, expensive industries. I kind of doubt Bitcoin would become a world reserve currency, but I do think there are countries where Bitcoin is more stable than the state sanctioned currency. Again what kicked off this thread was that inflation of the currency decreases purchasing power. Bitcoin's inflation will be less than USD starting next year, and continue to fall from there. That makes it (again, hypothetically, theoretically, this is not financial or investment advice) a better long term store of value than USD.

Bitcoin is also an open source lover's dream. With all the money currently in it, the fact that it hasn't been hacked (ok, there was one hard fork way back when) means that it's either unhackable or some smart hacker is very, very patient. So if you can securely hold a digital asset, potentially in a brain wallet, that could be filled with billions of dollar in value, that's truly world changing.

I'm rambling a bit, but to go back to the nerds point; banks keep saying they want to implement blockchain. This to me says their existing legacy system is so slow, so corruptible, that using a decentralized node verifying system designed to be slow and secure is somehow still faster than their processing. Such a system is inherently less secure than the main Bitcoin blockchain, so I don't believe in these side projects as much.

Really the best argument I've seen against Bitcoin is that when it becomes TOO good of a store of value, everyone buys it, the price skyrockets, everyone stops investing in everything else, the price skyrockets, and it's hard to denominate loans in something whose price is skyrocketing. That seems weirdly optimistic. Stablecoins like GeminiUSD or even Carbon bring some sanity to the blockchain and solve the loan issue, and I hope to be (almost) entirely cashed out long before everyone and their grandmother is investing in Bitcoin.

So yes, it's not viable to replace paper money right now. But how often do you use paper money? How viable is Google Wallet or Apply Pay? Again, people smarter than me are excited about very similar projects. Apple Pay costs 24% interest. Opening a Bitcoin lightning channel costs less than a penny.

Another medium term hurdle may be Gresham's law; bad money drives out good. All the bitcoin fans I know *don't want to spend their bitcoin* because they expect it to be more valuable than USD. That's... interesting.

saudiaramcoshill,"Banking is not really an oligopoly. First off, even if you want to just look at retail banking (the part of banking that we see as consumers), the space has a lot of competition. There's the brick and mortar led by WF/BofA/Citi/JPMorganChase. But even in that space, local banks are huge. Bank of the West, Texas capital, bbva, etc. all have retail spots, and big regional players like SunTrust or regions are kinda hard to ignore. And that's just brick and mortar. The online space if growing, and players like Goldman and MS are stepping in there, and groups like Ally are starting to take hold. So even in US retail banking, it's hard to say that deposits are dominated by the biggest four banks in the US or that they have an oligopoly, especially if you consider how little pricing power they seem to have over the market as a result of the supposed dominance.

But banking is much much larger than just retail banking. And on other products, foreign banks compete with the US banks in the US. Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC in Japan, BofC, CCB and others in China, BNP, credit ag, soc gen in France, Barclays, HSBC, RBS and more in the UK, and tons of other banks that you may or may not have ever heard of like credit Suisse or Deutsche Bank or Rabobank or BBVA or Santander. Banking is incredibly competitive. 

It may appear like an oligopoly if you only consider a tiny portion of their business and ignore the vast competition on a local level, but then again everything appears like an oligopoly if you just ignore the competition.",2019-01-27 03:41:02,ef1ckja,0,investing

fixanoid,"Sure thing. So here are feature details and how they relate:

- Privacy in Quorum means node privacy (not account level) meaning that N number of participating nodes on a given Quorum chain may send txns to each other in private. This is achieved through an off chain data payload transfer through a module we call private txn manager (there are a few for Quorum now, our main one is called Tessera: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera) -- this process is transparent to the users of the chain tho and it works as follows: a private txn originating from node 1 is passed through txn manager to the recipient(s) txn manager, and the payload written to blockchain is replaced by a hash of the secure payload. The originating node submits the txn to the chain, and it will get included into a block at some point. Recipients, when receiving this block will unpack it and see a private txn. The node will check with its private txn manager to see if it was a participant, and it was, then a payload is received from it and this payload is executed in the EVM. All private txns have their own state called private state. Much more detail is here: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/Transaction-Processing

- Consensus algos and finality are related in Quorum. First, finality simply means that Quorum disallows forks and modification of blocks post minting. This is enforced by consensus algos in Quorum, of which we currently support 3: Raft, Istanbul BFT, and Clique. Raft (https://raft.github.io/) is based on etcs raft implementation is is specifically designed to mint blocks as fast as possible and details of it are here: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/blob/master/raft/doc.md. Istanbul BFT is the algo that we offer which is byzantine tolerant -- this is a variant of POA that prevents forking. Here is the explanation eip by the author: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/650

fixanoid,"Hey op, so I actually work on the Quorum team, and can field some of the questions you may have, feel free to ask.

Quorum is a fork of the go-ethereum (geth) client with a few updates that add enterprise level features such as supporting private txns, node permissioning, fast consensus algorithms, block finality, and some others. It was originally created through a joint effort by JPMorgan and core engineers from the Ethereum Foundation. Beyond that, it has advanced to keep up with geth releases and has a full time team dedicated to it and its sub projects. There are some other bits I can add like it was the first EEA client and majority of EEA spec 1.0 was based on Quorum and that it is widely used and adopted in many companies such as SAP, Quorum EY, Microsoft with a ton of others looking into it. If you google ""quorum blockchain"" you are most likely to see some of the cooler projects built with it.

Quorum does not have a mainnet, and the expectation is that users of it set up their own network, be it private or otherwise (we are aware of several that are public). In most cases, we are not fully aware of everyone experimenting with Quorum, tho a fair chunk of people ends up on our support channels such as slack.

As far as actual innards -- Quorum keeps all of the EVM intact with a few things tweaked. If you are a Solidity developer, then most tools you are familiar with and work with will work on Quorum same way they do in Ethereum. Most of the enterprise features, including permissioning are configuration things. In our case, current permissions implementation is based on a whitelist and it means that a node will only connect to a well defined list of other nodes through a file thats a replica of static-nodes.json. The only obvious difference is patched sendTransaction method that includes support of a few fields to enable privacy features of Quorum. If you are interested to learn more, a great place to start is our wiki: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki. For a mode advanced development example, you should take a look at our 7nodes example here: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples. 

JPMorgan does not make money from developing or supporting Quorum directly, instead, Quorum is used internally and externally to build or replace existing pipes. There are also some new products being built with it externally as well, see https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/treasury-services/IIN for an example.

ArkyBeagle,"&gt; Even QE is not an example of seigniorage

Treasury doesn't have to sell them directly to the Fed; the Fed simply needs to make it known that they'll buy them from third parties. It is, as usual, a game of indirection. 

The alternative is to get receipts up. I'd much prefer that myself but I've unfortunately lived on the planet for the last 20 years and that gets thrown under the bus time after time. 

&gt; The Fed is also not a source of inequality.

It is *a* source, but not *the* source. How the thing people call inequality works now is from rents accrued to people who have access to privileged flows of capital. It's an engine for dumb money based on the interest rate spread. It works out to JPMorganChase being in effect something like a sovereign wealth fund, in part. 

The would all be good, but the Metric Formerly Known as M3 suffers for it. The normative assumption that the remains of the economy will simply pick up the slack is not holding. 

This is being used, right now, to finance M&amp;A that reduces actual economic output potential . 

I say ""the thing that people call inequality"" because it's the only thing that's substantially different since 2008. It's not a conspiracy or anything; it's just how that played out. The big banks would be off fiduciary responsibility to ""do things right.""

klaysHat,"The current testing involved both internal security tokens and using ETH tokens. [Quorum can easily do ETH transactions](https://i.imgur.com/IalBRuC.png) built right in. The Quorum node sits right on top of go-ethereum and pulls from it's API. You just can't use any of the private functions when making a public ETH transaction. So the private data can reside within the Constellation network while the confirmation data resides on the ethereum blockchain. 

I sent ETH to and from a Quorum node so I can guarantee you it works on the public chain. 

[It's a hybrid solution](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-docs/blob/master/Quorum_Architecture_20171016.pdf) that satisfies the banks itch for blockchain tech while remaining well-regulated.

klaysHat,"No there are others, including [the ever hated JP Morgan](https://m.newstimes.com/technology/businessinsider/article/75-banks-have-joined-JPMorgan-s-blockchain-13255712.php) who has their own blockchain called [Quorum.](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum) Their coalition with the Royal Bank of Canada, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, and the National Bank of Canada, along with 71 others make this the largest functioning inter-bank blockchain, hands down.

The announcement came after previously completed tests in development and live exchanges. 

I read the white paper for [Quorum.](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/blob/master/docs/Quorum%20Whitepaper%20v0.2.pdf) It's a very robust blockchain using a two stage permissioned system with a transaction manager and eth nodes. 

There are two ways they deal with fault tolerance. They don't, using Raft, which is their in-house non-Byzantine fault tolerant implementation. It has a leader/follower system where all transactions flow through one node. That node is the Central Bank of Canada currently, and soon to be the Fed. All the follower nodes (banks) send their information to the leader node (fed) and the leader 'mints' a block (I can't make this shit up folks). After the new block is minted then it requires a majority of nodes to verify.  

 It respects privacy between inter-network participants which allows for private transaction data along with pubic data and verifiable hashes for the private data. In this case the private data never leaves holding bank and only the hash and ETH carries forward along the network. 

This sub would bawk at that idea, and rightfully so. Since you all flow through one node.

However they have a second set of Quorum nodes that use a regular Istanbul BFT that is Byzantine fault tolerant up to 1/3rd of it's nodes being captured. Which isn't horrible but not that great either. 

However the banks love Raft, and it is still a blockchain implementation used in the real world even if it doesn't lend itself fully to our ideal system (cheap, open, secure, ~~no gov~~). It's going to make a lot of previously expensive transactions much cheaper and it's currently running on Ethereum. 

Both systems look very impressive so it's already touched a lot of lives and they might not even know it. ",2018-10-02 08:42:37,e702jg4,9,CryptoCurrency

davidw34,"Sure - to give a disclaimer, I was an analyst working in some of the product groups at JP, and a full on data engineer at C1. So I can speak from first hand experience at C1, while for JP it would be mostly my exposure to tech and stories from my coworkers. So - maybe they give fancy tech to the actual engineers, but maybe my experience as an analyst can shed some light on the culture too


Why I prefer C1:

- Big on new technology, especially AWS and the cloud. The CIO even spoke at re:invent (https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/capital-one/) and they are on a huge commitment to get everything to the cloud. Shows a commitment to new technologies, while at JP, when I interned, I didn't even get Office 2010 until I started full time in 2016

- When I started, I got a brand new Macbook pro with all sorts of fancy accessories, while at JP we used virtual machines that were incredibly slow, and didn't even get access to chrome until 2017

- JP felt much more ""stuffy enterprise big bank"" to me than C1. From the way the CEO speaks to what the offices look like and their precense on the internet, I think C1 is much more tech oriented. If you compare their GitHubs, you can see JP's (https://github.com/jpmorganchase) looks to be a lot of their Ethereum based product Quorum, while Capital One (https://github.com/capitalone) has a lot of different kinds of repos and even has a dedicated website to their open-source (https://developer.capitalone.com/open-source/)


Are there downsides? Sure. At C1, it is very dependent on your team as to what kinds of projects you'll be working on. Some teams are working on really cool machine learning stuff for the mobile app, while others are just helping keep the data streams running. Not to say one is more interesting than the other, but you have to be sure to interview with a team you would actually like to join.


One other thing is that at its heart, C1 is still a bank. This means, depending on the team, you will have to deal with bueracracy and getting approvals for everything. 


Overall, I think the image of C1 and the culture there is much more tech and CS oriented than JP. Again, my experience at JP was mostly that of an analyst and not an engineer, but I still do think JP's tech was very lacking. Their value add is in investment banking, big institutional clients, etc while C1 gets value out of producing good products for consumers",2018-07-19 02:56:13,e2mbc5l,11,cscareerquestions

pikk,"&gt; Why doesn't JPMorganChase just go down to Burger King and hire a bunch of teenagers to be hedge fund managers if it's so inevitable?

Because half the population hasn't been killed overnight? 

And burger flippers aren't going to become hedge fund managers (not that hedge fund managers outperform index funds anyway, but whatever). But burger flippers are likely to become bank representatives, and existing representatives are likely to become managers, and managers are likely to become regional heads, etc. 

When there's an excess of labor, it allows service industries to thrive, because they can pay basically nothing, and still have a ready supply of labor. 

When there's a labor shortage, businesses have to compete for employees, and they do that by raising wages, cutting into the already thin profit margins found in service industries. 

Not to mention, service industry locations are based on population densities, which are going to be halved, post-snap. So now you've got two McDick's a mile apart competing over 100,000 customers/day instead of 200,000.

""Proof of concept of Privacy using ZkSnarks""

""Privacy policy
Managing confidentiality and privacy in Ethereum is one of the challenges and priorities of the Ethereum
protocol. The use of ZkSnarks23 (Zero Knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) answers
this problem. ZkSnarks is part of the Ethereum roadmap but it will not be immediate.
Until the release of ZkSnarks of similar solution, we will work on 3 paths:
-Allowing public requests
-Introducing the concept of basic requests. A Request type that will not be a smart contract but an encrypted
hash on Filecoin
-Plasma chain. Plasma chain will allow ZkSnarks and we are following closely the Omise to work on them
-Eventually a temporary sidechain using [Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-docs/blob/master/Quorum%20Whitepaper%20v0.1.pdf) and private transactions connected to the public one

&gt;That depends on where in the spectrum we're talking about and how it's being treated. $1M cash, yeah, that's going to leave a larger footprint than $10k in cash. 

Cash is more traceable. From bills to bank movements. It's designed that way

There are cryptos that are designed to avoid being traced. Cryptos that have these features will never make it into mainstream adoption. 

&gt;Just because it's being combated on a massive scale doesn't mean that we don't have $1 Trillion+ annual fraud/laundering, again, much of it being facilitated by banks, of which we only catch a portion. I have no doubt that next year and the year after and the year after that, we will still be combating $1 Trillion+ of fraud/money laundering and that every single year we will be busting well known banks for it.

It's rare that a bank facilitates laundering. As a financial institution they get used by criminals. It's up to the banks to spot these movements, if they don't they can be held liable 

Crypto exchanges are used by criminals also, and likewise if they don't do their due diligence they are increasingly facing the same laws, rules and regulations

Volume doesn't mean anything. It's proportion. I don't believe anyone has a clue how much crypto is being used to faciliate crime, laundering and so on

Most crypto expenditure I know of is black market (buying drugs, etc)

&gt;How could cryptos be a better vehicle for fraud when the entire market is less than $0.5B and the fiat fraud/money laundering segment alone is over a trillion?

The fiat market is far larger than the crypto market. 

&gt;Just look at JPMorganChase. They're only interested in full transparency when it applies to the 99%, not to their own respective activities.

They are subject to the same laws, rules and scrutiny as other US banks. Every single entity they do business with is under obligation to spot any irregularities. If an underlying client or an underlying client moves 100 dollars against a sanctioned entity - then JPM can be held liable and punished accordingly (if they didn't meet compliance and requirements)

&gt;Every year without fail, dozens of the world's largest financial institutions are busted for money laundering. As long as the fines are less than the profits, the same behavior will continue by the ""too big to fail"" banks.

??

This is the equivalent of claiming that cinemas all around the world ""facilitate"" criminal activity because criminal money indirectly flows through them

Financial institutions get used by criminals - there are heavy fines and reputational damage if the bank hasn't done everything to prevent it from their end

We work directly in this area. It's tighter than just about any other industry out there, however there are still cases due to the fact that it involves millions of employees and billions of customers

neoliberal_undergrad,"Who doesn't remember what happened to them as a child?  I remember the financial crisis in more depth than you probably do.  But the point is - the regulations put on the banks and stress tests are more than adequate.

Breaking up the banks sounds great - but there's no action plan.  Are you going to just break up JPMorganChase and its tens of thousands of employees?  Or are you going to regulate its risk...

I'm totally fine if you export our hundreds of thousands of well paying banking jobs because of your irrational attachment to ""breaking up the banks"", but at least take a look at what current regulations do.

To your second point. Read the article.

&gt; Pelosi gave solace to supporters of the public option, saying that its intent will largely be fulfilled with other provisions in the bill. 

&gt; ""While it may not have a public option, we have a purpose of the public option served by the exchanges"" and other reforms, she said.

If my memory serves me correct, Pelosi and Obama wanted a public option, but Joe Lieberman didn't.  Passing a public option wasn't feasible in that environment because it would be unpopular - and Pelosi being the super smart vote counter she is, crafted a bill that would pass.

&gt; You can be a hawk even if the Republicans are militaristic and violent to the point it would have been too far for Kubrick to parody them in Dr. Strangelove, yes.

Cloud9,"&gt; Cash is more traceable than many cryptos right now. Physical items like precious stones are even more traceable.

That depends on where in the spectrum we're talking about and how it's being treated. $1M cash, yeah, that's going to leave a larger footprint than $10k in cash. Nevertheless, in the 'right' hands it can be untraceable.

So I would disagree with a blanket statement that cash, in and of itself, is MORE traceable than crypto.
It's also how people hide it, denominations, etc. Some people can hide $1M in cash better than some idiot running around with $10k in cash. So there are several variables at play that need to be considered.

&gt; The world is combating cash fraud/laundering, on a massive scale.

So what else is new? Just because it's being combated on a massive scale doesn't mean that we don't have $1 Trillion+ annual fraud/laundering, again, much of it being facilitated by banks, of which we only catch a portion. I have no doubt that next year and the year after and the year after that, we will still be combating $1 Trillion+ of fraud/money laundering and that every single year we will be busting well known banks for it. 

&gt; Cryptos are a better vehicle for fraud. Untraceable, private dark digital currencies are easier to hide.

Cryptos =/= untraceable. That's a sub-category of cryptos. Maybe ~10-15% of cryptos fall into that category. 

How could cryptos be a better vehicle for fraud when the entire market is less than $0.5B and the fiat fraud/money laundering segment alone is over a trillion? Crypto can't even accommodate the fiat corruption and that would be assuming that 100% of crypto is fraudulent, while the reality is that it's a sub-segment, just as it's a sub-segment in fiat.

&gt; It's not current volumes which are the worry.. it's the future potential of this

Again, it depends. The authorities have many tools to trace bitcoin and most other cryptos. The potential goes both ways. Crypto holds enormous potential for transparency in the financial services and government sectors where the money can be traced, but you'll notice that the first thing financial institutions (and governments) are interested in when adopting crypto is the privacy aspect, the untraceable dark money. Just look at JPMorganChase. They're only interested in full transparency when it applies to the 99%, not to their own respective activities. 

&gt; Most laundering is done by criminals and is being combated by financial institutions themselves - who face massive reputational damage, fines, loss of license (ABLA recently) and shutdown if they fail to spot laundering (not even taking part)

And yet, they continually facilitate it year after year after year. Every year without fail, dozens of the world's largest financial institutions are busted for money laundering. As long as the fines are less than the profits, the same behavior will continue by the ""too big to fail"" banks.

* Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists—a culture unto themselves, fueled by the successes of the computer industry
* Your neighborhood plumber or other repair service—dependent on local customers and banks
* Koch Industries / Verizon / JPMorganChase and their various agencies—activists for their own interests, deeply entangled in politics
* Saudi Aramco, Samsung, Rosneft, Chinese banks—state-allied giants
* Apple / Microsoft—with their technical empires and ecosystems
* Google / Facebook / TenCent—very different personalities, similar positions

BitcoinIsTehFuture,"&gt;JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.

&gt;New competitors have emerged. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. **Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation**. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies.

&gt;Ongoing or increased competition may put downward pressure on prices and fees for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share. This competition may be on the basis of, among other factors, quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.

Banks are just businesses. Every time you deposit money in the bank, it’s a liability for the bank. They owe you that money.

Stolen from me
Billions of dollars
Dollars for free

Seriously, though. I dealt with this at a job I worked. The assistant manager wanted me up and running by whatever time I had to start. But I wasn't allowed to make my time reflect that. This was a minimum 5 minutes every day, 5 days a week. Which I thought was bullshit. I later found out that was illegal, so I did nothing for work until the time I was scheduled to start. No one said anything.

A couple months later, corporate sent out a company wide memo reminding managers that hourly employees weren't even allowed to log in until their scheduled start time. Since it was a company wide memo, that meant it was a rampant problem throughout the country for this company (cough::jpmorganchase::cough) and they were probably sued over it.

At 5 mins a day (and sometimes longer), five days a week, for about a year, that comes to about 1,300 pre tax dollars stolen from me unless I suck at math. I didn't realize it was that much. That makes me furious. Even if it was only for 6 months (which I'm sure it wasn't), that's still a lot for me then and now.",2017-11-21 06:58:20,dq43qx4,2,dataisbeautiful
PilpushAndPilpul,"&gt; I'd like to see some evidence he's done very much to help our country.

He's ensured we're not taken advantage of by the TPP and the Paris Climate Accord, so I'd say he's done better than his competitor would have already. But aside from that, [he's doing pretty great on the economy and unemployment: You know, the things he promised to fix](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jpmorganchase/2017/11/10/wnba-star-nneka-ogwumike-shares-the-many-ways-she-invests-in-herself/#36aecd356db1)

&gt;Of course we would care just show us the proof.

No, you wouldn't. And it's pretty rich you say that when states refused to hand over the very data that would allow such a claim to be verified. It's like a man locking a candle in a box and then claiming ""the only way I'd believe you is if you had the candle"".

&gt;Look, trump voters have to make a very simple decision. Russia interfered in our election. That is a fact

Is it though? Because first they ""meddled"", then they ""influenced"" and now they ""interfered"". All of them nebulous terms without legal definitions, so let's look at it.  
Russia didn't ""interfere"". They didn't impede process, or stop elections from happening, or change ballots, or forge votes, or anything. To ""interfere"" would require changing the course of normal election routine: Something they didn't do. Now we do know they influenced the election, but that's nothing new, or even illegal. After all, AIPAC influenced the election more than Russia could have hoped, but we seem to be okay with that one. We know Russia bought ads... that favored Clinton, since they knew the best way to influence would be to just prop up Clinton as who she is and have people be turned off naturally.  
But what else did they do? They apparently ""hacked databases"" since the hack left a Russian signature... which if you know anything about cyber-security, is pretty much a guarantee that Russia WASN'T responsible for that, since no sane group would leave their own signature on a cyber-attack. We know they hacked the DNC... only they didn't, and it's been repeatedly demonstrated and admitted that the leaks came from insiders. We know they gave that information to wikileaks... which they didn't by both their and wikileaks admission. So which part of what they did are you referring to when you say ""they interfered in our elections""? Is it one of the proven accusations, or the dozens upon dozens of accusations since proven false?

&gt;If you voted for trump you have to decide if you care about Russian interference, and determine if it influences your thinking on trump

Why would it determine my thinking on a person who had nothing to do with it? 

&gt;If It comes out tomorrow that 5 million undocumented immigrants threw the popular vote for Clinton I'd start saying trump won the popular vote

But you wouldn't DO anything, would you? You'd make the concession but you wouldn't advocate any action because when it's beneficial to your interests you couldn't give less of a fuck. And though you'll likely claim that you totally care since that's convenient for you to do in this discussion, [the reality is that you know it happens and you are apathetic towards it at worst, and hinder investigation of it at best](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/19/noncitizen-illegal-vote-number-higher-than-estimat/)

&gt;What is the case is that Russia helped trump get elected

No, that's still unproven. They spread pro-Trump messages (and even pro-hillary messages when it became obvious she was her own worst enemy) but there's been no proof that had any effect on votes. And even then, saying that ""facebook ads = helping win an election"" is a huge stretch lad.

&gt;and helped to foster chaos as well

Hahaha holy shit what? How the fuck did they help foster chaos? You sure it wasn't the ""half the country is racists and should die and we hate them this isn't their America"" shit wasn't what made Chaos? Facebook ads don't seem too chaotic, to me at least.

&gt;You deal with each individual problem as it comes. So right now it's Russia. Maybe next election it's China. We deal with each one as it comes, not throw our hands in the air bc everyone does it?

But you're incredibly disingenuous there, because you don't actually give two fucks. You're not mad there was interference, since you never complained about foreign interference in American politics for years, despite it being rife what with China, AIPAC, and even the recently discovered Uranium One scandal. Not a peep. Because foreign interference isn't what upsets you: You're upset that you lost, and you're looking for ANY ammo to try and reverse that. ",2017-11-13 21:00:46,dpr1qru,1,AskTrumpSupporters

thetrickykid,"A person's spending patterns is only very lightly correlated to their income^1

There are some soft boundaries in that spending more than you have means you need access to credit, which diminishes the further from your ability to effectively repay. But those probably don't matter much when we're talking about ""only"" thousands of dollars, since that amount of credit is very easy to obtain for most Americans.

There's also the fact that for some, spending money is an act of gaining status. IE, people who spend a lot of money in game, get status in game and feel good about that. This may be completely divorced from income level, since in today's society status is accumulated in other ways^2.

craigc123,"I am prepared to receive a slew of down-votes here, but I wanted to share my opinion. I want to start by saying I think Lisk is a very promising project, and I think it has a lot of potential. 

I think it is a bit misguided to suggest it will surpass Ethereum right now though. Saying it will surpass Neo and Stratis, I may be able to get on board with.

I am a software developer and have extensive experience with JavaScript as well as Node.js. I may be in the minority, but I find Node.js annoying to work with. It has a low barrier to entry, but that does not mean it is a superior language. I personally prefer Go and Python. 

The numbers here refer to the numbered points in the article

1. When it comes to writing smart contracts, I think using a language like JavaScript is more dangerous than using anything else. The low barrier to entry means that there will be a huge number of buggy contracts that will lead to millions of dollars being stolen. It is pretty well known that there is a LOT of bad JavaScript code. For every one good project written in JavaScript, there are 100 bad ones. Imagine what the headlines will look like when lots of money is being stolen due to buggy code. Using a statically typed language has a number of advantages for critical code that deals with handling financial transactions. I am not saying that solidity is great (it too has led to stolen funds), but I don’t think the argument that JavaScript is the more popular language and therefore Lisk is going to surpass Ethereum is very strong. 

2. Ethereum’s code is open source. Anyone can spin up a private chain using `geth` and run smart contracts/code on it. You can pre-allocate ether or set the mining difficulty in a configuration file. Most of the companies joining the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance are already planning on using it that way. You can have a look at quorum if you do not believe me: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum.

3. As mentioned in point two, what you said is false.

4. If you use a private Ethereum chain you can pre-allocate tokens as I mentioned so the proof of work vs. proof of stake doesn’t really matter there.

5. I am not sure if you have ever seen MEW https://www.myetherwallet.com, but it is extremely simple to use and works great.

6. Paying a company for a code audit is pretty much useless. At the last place I worked at, we did something like that and the report that they generated was mostly garbage. They uncovered a few legitimate issues, but most of the issues were just things that an automated tool detected, and a lot of the issues were not actually severe/exploitable. Using bounty systems like hackerone is a much better way to go to outsource it to the community. If people are getting paid to discover bugs they are not going to care what language your app is written in.

I am not saying that Ethereum is perfect. It has a lot of issues, but I don’t think that just because Lisk is written in JavaScript that it is going to immediately surpass it. It takes a lot more than a programming language. I have learned over the years that good programmers have no trouble picking up new languages. The types of people who end up stuck with a single language (the ones who only know JavaScript) are likely not the best programmers. 

I think lowering the barrier to entry to write dApps and work with blockchains is great, and if Lisk is able to do that then great, but it is going to take more than that to surpass Ethereum. Think about all the companies that have already joined the EEA. They aren’t going to immediately abandon Ethereum the second something new comes along. It is part of the reason Bitcoin is still going strong despite the fact that there are plenty of coins that are more profitable to mine, scale better, and have lower transaction fees.

I think it is important for any investor to have a level-headed understanding of the entire picture.",2017-08-26 07:26:35,dm4revt,23,Lisk

Booty_Bumping,"Because they (organizations that have joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) decided it might be a viable alternative. Ethereum is pretty well established and is ready for alternative consensus algorithms, so it would make sense that they would choose it over a homegrown solution.

I don't understand the topic enough to know what these private chains are capable of replacing (and actually providing tangible security advantages) but I imagine they know what they're talking about.

From what I understand the two major advantages are

- Auditable, detailed logs of all events that would be very difficult to tamper with. If it needs to be tampered with (due to a smart contract bug) then it is a very explicit process that could be backed by cryptographic trust (e.g. reverting a transaction requires multiple cryptographic signatures from a group of trusted people)
- The ability to securely share your financial database with other organizations without having to put enormous trust in one organization. Making fraudulent transactions would require collusion between multiple parties as well as those in charge of securing nodes.

&gt;Finally, if you need some extra help dispelling the quaint notion that the people who run the world are honest and transparent and helpful, then the following two (admittedly highly conjectural) posts might help spell things out a bit more explicitly for you:

&gt;
&gt;&gt; The owners of Blockstream are spending $75 million to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin by manipulating the Core devs &amp; the Chinese miners. This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.

&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;Sorry I don't have any more time right now to ""school"" you further on this subject. 
&gt;
&gt;Ideally, learning should be a self-driven process anyways - once someone helps you get started.
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;**Some advice**
&gt;
&gt;Finally, if I may give you some parting advice.
&gt;
&gt;If you want to be truly respected on these forums, you're probably going to have to stop going around acting like such a [doe-eyed](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doe+eyed&amp;t=hb&amp;ia=web) innocent little [pollyanna](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pollyanna). 
&gt;
&gt;It is assumed that most people here already pretty much know the harsh reality of how the world works, and are trying to use Bitcoin as a way to not get screwed over by this harsh reality. 
&gt;
&gt;So some of the more informed people around here might not have much patience with you (or trust in you) if you don't even understand the basic principles outlined above, namely:
&gt;
&gt;1. Our planet is being run by an exclusive club of rich assholes who have immense power, because _we_ ""allow"" _them_ to _print out money_ (which they then hand out to their buddies, not to us - basically enslaving us).
&gt;
&gt;2. Bitcoin was designed (many believe) to help fix this dire situation.
&gt;
&gt;3. The _ancien régime_ (those people who up till now who have been running the world, due to their ability to print money) _might not like Bitcoin for this reason, and might try to do something to stop it_ - and they might not tell you why they're doing it - and they might not even tell you that they _are_ doing it in the first place!
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to be such a curmudgeon, but pollyannas like you tend to get on my nerves after a while - not least because it seems to me that one of the factors which allows those rich assholes to continue to stay in power and run the world is because so many uninformed credulous people like you either can't or won't just wake up and open your goddamn eyes and see how you're getting fucked over by this whole ""web of debt"" based around that exclusive ""club"" of rich assholes who get free money which the bankers are simply printing up out of thin air.
&gt;
&gt;So, 99% of people in the world are living lives of quiet desperation and oppression, becoming poorer and poorer - while the rich keep getting richer and richer (with all that money they keep printing out of thin air - which by the way, if [you do the math](https://np.reddit.com/user/ydtm?sort=top), ends up making _your_ money worth less) - and now there are finally some serious attempts at revolution or change afoot, to try to fix some of this mess - and you've just wandered in to a meeting where some of these people struggling for change are making plans, and you basically keep going around asking ""What are you guys so worked up about?""
&gt;
&gt;Maybe if you also realized that _you are saying the exact same thing that the oppressors are always saying_ (basically some variation of ""Nothing to see here, move on!"") - then maybe that will provide _another_ hint to you as to why some people have been less-than-totally-welcoming of your non-stop naïve-sounding questions.
&gt;
&gt;**Every subreddit has a topic - plus certain assumptions**
&gt;
&gt;For comparison: Would you wander around on a subreddit about fitness or weightlifting constantly asking: ""Why do you want to get in shape?""? (Or maybe here's an even better comparison: Would you wander around on a subreddit for some oppressed group, and keep asking ""Why would anyone be oppressing you?""?) 
&gt;
&gt;There are certain _""givens""_ which are assumed on a subreddit - and one of the _""givens""_ for a lot of people on this subreddit is that the current monetary regime running the world is not working for most people (or: it is _oppressing_ most people), and so we need something better. (Also another one of the _""givens""_ is that r\bitcoin is censoring everyone's posts - and that Blockstream is damaging Bitcoin.)
&gt;
&gt;Nobody is forcing you to get into fitness or weightlifting - and nobody is forcing you to get into Bitcoin. Maybe you think your physique is already fine the way it is, so you don't see the point of fitness or bodybuilding - and maybe you think that VISA and PayPal and JPMorganChase and Wells Fargo and the Fed and the ECB or whatever are fine for you, so you don't see the point of Bitcoin. (Or maybe you were born a millionaire so you don't feel financially oppressed.) You're free to get involved or not get involved. Most people who are here are involved for some particular reason. And whatever that reason may be, it usually tends to involve using Bitcoin as it was designed in the whitepaper - in order to improve their lives. And part of this also means actually _using Bitcoin as it was designed in the whitepaper_ - free of any interference from companies like Blockstream - or their financial backers AXA - who might not really want us to be able to use Bitcoin the way it was designed in the whitepaper.
&gt;
&gt;In particular, it has been quite obvious for years to people on r/btc that the _actions_ of r\bitcoin and Blockstream have been damaging to Bitcoin (whatever their actual _motives_ may be - which we may ultimately never even be able to find out since they're probably never going to actually _tell_ us) - but meanwhile we've had to fight tooth and nail to get a vast brainwashed army of pollyannas - a lot of whom quite frankly sound a lot like you -  to understand that Satoshi did _not_ design Bitcoin to work like _this_:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Every Core supporter wants to run their own node. Apparently to help banks settle transactions, instead of their own transactions.
&gt;
&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qgy7s/every_core_supporter_wants_to_run_their_own_node/
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;Satoshi designed Bitcoin to work like _this_:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bitcoin Original: Reinstate Satoshi's original 32MB max blocksize. If actual blocks grow 54% per year (and price grows 1.54^2 = 2.37x per year - Metcalfe's Law), then in 8 years we'd have 32MB blocks, 100 txns/sec, 1 BTC = 1 million USD - 100% on-chain P2P cash, without SegWit/Lightning or Unlimited
&gt;
&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;**We all have our own reasons for being here.**
&gt;
&gt;So hopefully that gives you some background regarding why many people are here on this subreddit in the first place, and what some of our goals and desires are. 
&gt;
&gt;We want to use Bitcoin - and we don't want the bankers funding Blockstream or the censors silencing r\bitcoin to get in our way. 
&gt;
&gt;We understand that Bitcoin is a _disruptive_ technology which could be _liberating_ and _empowering_ for many of us in various ways.
&gt;
&gt;We are realistic about the fact (ie, we take it as a ""given"") that certain powerful individuals or institutions might not _want_ us to be empowered and liberated like this (maybe because their power depends on our enslavement).
&gt;
&gt;And so we allow for the possibility that certain powerful individuals or institutions might be trying to stop us - and that they might not even have the courtesy to _inform_ us that they are trying to stop us.
&gt;
&gt;I should of course clarify that these are ultimately really only _my_ reasons for being on this forum. 
&gt;
&gt;Other people may have their own reasons - some the same as me, and some different from me - and so I can only speak for myself. 
&gt;
&gt;It is important for all of us - me, you and everyone else - to have a clear understanding of _why we are here._ 
&gt;
&gt;In particular, if you - u/guysir - ever felt like giving people a brief explanation of why _you_ are here - then that might help people understand why you keep asking the kind of questions you keep asking.
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;**Why people are rejecting Blockstream's heavily modified version of Bitcoin - and sticking with Satoshi's original version of Bitcoin (now called Bitcoin Cash or BCC)**
&gt;
&gt;The above reasons are why many of us will not use [AXA-owned](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) Blockstream's Bitcoin.
&gt;
&gt;We want to continue using Satoshi's original Bitcoin, now being renamed Bitcoin Cash (ticker: BCC, or BCH) - because we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of:
&gt;
&gt;- simple &amp; safe [on-chain scaling](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/) for cheaper and faster p2p transactions and higher value for our bitcoins, and 
&gt;
&gt;- simple &amp; safe [on-chain signature validation](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qftjc/holy_shit_greg_maxwell_and_peter_todd_both_just/) for maximum security for our bitcoins.

Pressondude,"Because despite everyone's impressions that insurance companies are crazy fatcats who just print money, they're actually not doing that well. I've done this analysis before, but I'm going to do it again here, because I'm bored.

Largest insurance companies in the US are:
* UnitedHealth Group, Revenue $184.8B, Net Income $7.01B
* Anthem Inc, $85B, $2.46B
* Aetna, $63.175B, $2.271B

So, everybody looks at that goes, wow, they made money in the billions. They're printing money. But, that's a pre-Economics 101 understanding of corporate health. Let's look at the profit margin for these companies, which is simply [Net Income]/[Revenue].

* UnitedHealth: 3.8%
* Anthem: 2.89%
* Aetna: 3.59%

I mean, this is hardly printing money. They haven't lost money yet, but it's entirely possible that some of these insurance marketplaces are actually (despite their high fees) operating at or even below cost. There's no undercutting someone in that situation. None of this includes any analysis of equity or assets. Insurance is an expensive business to operate in, if the profits sink too low, it's not worthwhile to pump money into an insurance company. This will become a bigger problem as the Fed raises interest rates again.

For comparison, profit margins at Apple are 21.19%, at Ford are 3.02%, Johnson &amp; Johnson are 23.01%, JPMorganChase are 25.85, MetLife 3.98%, Berkshire Hathaway (owns GEICO) 10.76%, AIG .007%. I'd encourage you to look at some other companies you may be more personally acquainted with, and also look at Return on Assets. Profit margin is a fairly simplistic (though quick and easy) way of looking at the health of a business. RoA and RoE are more advanced but also more useful.",2017-07-20 00:19:52,dkflueo,2,AskAnAmerican
Happy1013,"Agent Lilic from 6 months ago.  I'm so pumped to see where Eth is at 6 months from now.

&gt;My tweet was not related to Enterprise Ethereum but rather that ConsenSys (and others) have been working across industries and sectors with Fortune 500's for nearly two years building out a variety of applications and solutions. In that time, we've seen our counterparts on the enterprise side develop some spectacular solutions including JP Morgan's Quorum https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum
Much of the work we do with enterprise clients and partners is not broadly disseminated because of things like NDA's, however we should expect to see a number of projects go public in 2017. To be clear; when we talk about 'blockchain' in the context of Fortune 500 adoption, what we're talking about is Ethereum and that will become even more apparent in the coming year.
For those that are quick to speculate on things like ""Why are people commenting like this is good news? Private Ethereum implementations don't benefit us"", I would say that many organizations realize public Ethereum is ultimately going to be where most business processes reside and we should not dismiss the value of private blockchain ecosystems in assisting and accelerating the development and adoption of the public network- the relationship is symbiotic.

Beethovens_69th,"I think he is kind of warping the idea of using historical context to make a political argument against leftist professors. At least speaking for sociology, one of the main ideas when making assessments of contemporary real-world situations is that you have to have a broader context to have a more-full understanding. Using his example of slavery, one could simply say white people today have nothing to do with slavery because they personally weren't involved in it. However, if you look at things like racial income-inequality, disparity in incarceration rates, etc., a lot of the discrimination against black people that exists today has linkages to slavery via Jim Crow and other historical racial systems of oppression. So although slavery might not seem relevant to racism at a quick glance, one can see and study how the same racial structures that were developed during slavery have direct and indirect linkages to what people's contemporary experiences are, and so arguably white people still benefit from these structures as they are linked to slavery. For example, a lot of businesses today have direct links to the slave trade, like AIG and JPMorganChase. To understand how the ultra-wealthy exist today it might behoove you to understand their historical links to slavery and other systems of exploitation and oppression, to see that they did not simply get rich off of an equal playing field.",2017-06-21 11:20:44,dj6ocpn,0,news

samacharbot2,"Seven Indian companies receive less H-1B visas in 2016: Report

---

&gt;* In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indianbased companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years, said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush.

&gt;* Among the top companies with new H1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &amp;Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst &amp; Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo!

&gt;* The unemployment rate for architecture and engineering occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields.

&gt;* An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said.

&gt;* This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area, the report said.

There is a good deal of internal discussion within the EEA about whether even _specifications_ endorsed by the EEA should be written to match public Eth. My own view is that forcing EEA members to unfork to the public chain would restrict innovation in the private Ethereum space (see [Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow), [Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum)). Permissioned implementations operate with very different security assumptions; from their perspective public Eth has a lot of baggage (e.g. POW mining) which is simply not necessary for the problems they solve.

Given that we can't even agree whether the public chain should be the technical standard the EEA follows, I think that signing a letter in favour of a given ETF to support the market for tokens on the public chain (which, in our view, is just one of many Ethereum instances in existence out there) would be out of scope for most of the membership - technically and commercially. Ofc we wish an applicant luck but I don't really see increasing liquidity in the public chain space as being core to the EEA's mission.",2017-05-06 03:55:12,dh6h31s,5,ethereum
bobsummerwill,"Hyperledger isn't a specific technology.   It's a Linux Foundation banner project for multiple blockchain and DLT technologies, each of which have different characteristics:

See https://www.hyperledger.org/projects.

The common theme to them all is that they are permissioned, and none involve cryptocurrencies.

Monax's Burrow project (formerly ErisDB) was recently accepted, which is a permissioned EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) node implementation.   So now the other Hyperledger projects have the option of integrating an Ethereum virtual machine into their codebases too.

https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow

Fabric is the dominant project within HL.   It was developed as OpenChain by IBM and contributed to Hyperledger at inception, and has been working towards a 1.0 release which is imminent.   It is the basis of the IBM Blockchain commercial offering, and is getting a lot of traction in Enterprise settings.

https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/

The primary aim of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) is to build an extension/variant of the public Ethereum specification to cover the additional use-cases which Enterprises need to get into production - along the themes of scalability (usually just pluggable consensus), privacy and confidentiality and permissioning.    JPM Quorum is an example of an Ethereum fork seeking to meet those needs:

https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum

Many of us see all of the public/consortium/private use-cases as being something which will likely converge over the next few years.  Sufficiently modular codebases should be able to handle them all, with dynamic composition of components.   We are working towards the creation of an extended Ethereum meeting all those needs.",2017-05-04 12:32:13,dh3xtsc,14,ethereum

2) Find tutorials created in the last few months. Even in the 'notsogreedy's post, some of those tutorials reference libraries that aren't being used. This area is moving quite fast.

3) The easiest tool I've found to get started has been found here: https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum. This is the most complete set-up process I've found. It creates a private blockchain and gives you an IDE to develop on. This is what I'm using to learn Solidity.

bobsummerwill,"You are wrong.  Amber is awesome.

Amber has been instrumental in the creation of Quorum which is JPM's first ever open source project, adding private transactions and various other features:

https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum

Their fantastic team has been working with Jeff Wilcke on that project for the last year or so.   The availability of a permissioned Ethereum variant (based on geth) with private transaction support has opened up Ethereum for immediate use in various companies which might have been stuck on Corda or Fabric if Quorum didn't exist.  JPM drove for that, because without those private transactions they would not have been able to use Ethereum at all.

Here she is with Vitalik and some of us EEA folk back in January during a full-day Quorum and Cakeshop training event which she hosted:

https://twitter.com/BobSummerwill/status/840634790214746113

Amber has been deeply involved in the setup of the EEA, and bringing the weight of those Fortune 500 organizational resources to bear on Ethereum, so that we can mature the technology quicker, and provide a path for some of these permissioned systems to make their way to the public-chain in the future when we are further down the scalability and privacy roadmap.

JPM were instrumental in the creation of that group, and their involvement (and event hosting) has drawn many other large companies into EEA.

Demonizing the status quo is very easy to do, but it really isn't very helpful - especially when you pick on individuals who are the progressive ones looking to disrupt existing industries from within.

We will have a mixture of revolution and evolution, but I suspect that there will be an awful lot more evolution than you might expect.  There is a huge volume of technical legacy underlying our society, and you cannot rip that out in a hurry.

masta,"So I'd say I'm an expert on passwords...... of course, who isn't, right? But no really, I am an expert.

So breaking this out:

&gt; Must be 8-32 characters long

8 chars in the lower/upper/number set is only 62^8 or 218,340,105,584,896 (trillions). Remember that length always trumps character set complexity. I think hashcat with a decent GPU can do like ~500k hash/s, and that is tractable to clustering GPUs for linear growth. To make it worse, that character space is already cracked and in databases, so effectively those passwords are already cracked (so long as you have access to unsalted hashes).

&gt; Must include at last one UPPERCASE, one lowercase and one number

These kind of rules do make sense,but ONLY for short passwords &gt;= 14 length range. After that the rules can be relaxed.

&gt; Must not have special characters or punctuation

For short passwords this kind of rule is considered harmful, however for longer passwords this kind of rule is workable.

&gt; Must be different than your previous five Passwords

Major red flag. In the worst case the implementation compares current candidate secret with wive the clear-text of previous secrets. In the best case it's just comparing the resulting hash.

&gt; Must not include your Email ID partly or fully

&gt; Must not include your First Name or Last Name

These are not entirely bad, but only in the context of short passwords. For long pass phrases it's totally fine to relax this rule.

&gt; Must not include more than 2 identical characters

This is considered harmful. It actually weakens the password complexity SIGNIFICANTLY. The adversary does not have to permutate anymore. 

&gt; Must not include more than 2 consecutive characters

Considered harmful. I'm not sure where this idea came from, and the reason that 2 identical (or more) characters is GOOD is because the adversary watching you type the password has difficulty seeing when you quickly double-tap a character. A quick double tap significantly makes shoulder-surfing more difficult. Also, it does not really reduce the complexity in any meaningful way. Remember length always trumps character set complexity.

&gt; Must not use the name of the financial institution (JPM, MORGAN, JPMORGAN, CHASE, JPMORGANCHASE, JPMC)

For short password preventing dictionary attacks makes sense, but when you go over 14 chars the idea of dictionary attacks is less significant.


In the past I've implemented a password policy like this:

* Must be over 20 characters

* must be all lower case

* no punctuation

* no numbers

* must contain at least one space char,

* space char may not  not appear at the beginning or end (sigh).

At first this policy enraged people, because it violated all the garbage password policy dogma they have ever known, until they realized they could create highly memorable pass PHRASES. The last rule was bolted on because I had a few hold-outs who refused to play, but I eventually removed it. If you really don't want to have a phrase, that's fine (and they used a password manager). Over time I actually relaxed all but the first rule, but for people new to pass phrases, unfortunately a weird rule like this totally makes sense.",2017-01-25 21:50:08,dcvwih0,1,sysadmin

Highlyasian,"Sure, I don't mind sharing.

I had a sub-par GPA (3.3 or something around that) in highschool, but 1 full year of AP credits. I went to a [Public Ivy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Ivy) on a decent package and graduated in 3 years with a degree in Business. I was decently active in student orgs, did case competitions, played LoL &amp; WoW casually since I didn't have as much free time, but I met others who played and it was a great way to make friends. I also spoke at commencement but not because of my GPA (not even close, 3.2 again!)

I then took a half year break afterwards since I finished early. I spent it with my family &amp; friends, and also got all the stuff I wanted to do out of my systems. Marathoned a ton of movies, animes, shows, and played through a ton of backlogged video games. Also got back into raiding on WoW.

I then got a job as a Business Analyst for the largest ______ retailer on the East Coast. If you live anywhere between Maine &amp; Georgia, you'll know one of our subsidiaries. I'm living pretty comfortably in a 1 bedroom apartment, have my own car, and my job pays for me to travel all over the place. I'm also going to be relocating soon for a half year project abroad in Europe, and they're going to pay for everything while I'm abroad. 

I'm able to help my parents with any bills or expenses they need assistance with, buy them gifts, and I'm going to be flying out my family to visit me in Europe for vacation. 

Professionally, my career started well and is progressing fast now. Hobby wise, I don't have as much time but I still manage to raid 2-days a week in WoW and keep up with shows I want to. Family and socially, I'm now able to give back to others.

Most of my classmates from highschool who took AP classes with me are in similar situations. Off the top of my head: Microsoft, JPMorganChase, General Mills, General Motors + Grad School, US State Department + Cambridge, and Busch the beer company. They are now all over the US and one is abroad for his grad school.

I also think I'm the lowest earner among my immediate circle of friends, but I'm also the only non-STEM major and business majors ramps up over time instead of starting higher (plus, I'm sure I still get to slack off with less work than they do, much like highschool.)

They all attended the best school in our state, or a general equivalent in another state. I haven't really kept in touch with the ones who went to the Ivy League level schools, but from what I hear they're doing very well and are raking it in. 

Those who went to community college or a commuter/cardinal school never graduated, work in retail jobs, or stayed in state and work for small businesses. To my knowledge, only one or two have really broken that mold and caught up to where the rest of us are career wise.

My tweet was not related to Enterprise Ethereum but rather that ConsenSys (and others) have been working across industries and sectors with Fortune 500's for nearly two years building out a variety of applications and solutions. In that time, we've seen our counterparts on the enterprise side develop some spectacular solutions including JP Morgan's Quorum https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum
Much of the work we do with enterprise clients and partners is not broadly disseminated because of things like NDA's, however we should expect to see a number of projects go public in 2017. To be clear; when we talk about 'blockchain' in the context of Fortune 500 adoption, what we're talking about is Ethereum and that will become even more apparent in the coming year. For those that are quick to speculate on things like ""Why are people commenting like this is good news? Private Ethereum implementations don't benefit us"", I would say that many organizations realize public Ethereum is ultimately going to be where most business processes reside and we should not dismiss the value of private blockchain ecosystems in assisting and accelerating the development and adoption of the public network- the relationship is symbiotic. Onwards and upwards.

Enterprise applications, scalability, privacy, Microsoft, security, hype, Deloitte, derivatives, Consensys. That's what I got out of the article. Literally no info on what this project is about. I'd rather wait for the actual announcement rather than the announcement of the announcement.
[–]Jmlubin *******
This was leaked before we were ready to announce anything concrete, unfortunately. We have rushed to write a description of the project which will be released Monday.
In broad strokes, it is a bunch of companies, large and small that are using and building on Ethereum, both in the public blockchain context and private permissioned contexts, who are organizing to build architectures that they need in their work, at the protocol level and application layer, and also ensuring that core public Ethereum is strong and well resourced and that the roadmap towards 2.0 and beyond has the best talent available to execute it.
This group is very interested in seeing a strong Ethereum Foundation and leadership of the EF has been involved from the beginning and did indeed participate in that meeting.
[–]BullBearBabyWhale
This makes me so confident about the future of Ethereum as a backbone for decentralized business logic execution. Your work is much appreciated.
U simply can't overestimate the importance and network effects of such commitments. I would consider myself a rather conservative investor but information like these and the general positive, development friendly environment surrounding Ethereum made me buy a big chunk of ETH and i even plan to found a Ethereum related startup. And i'm sure i'm not the only one acting for similar reasons. Let's show the world the power of this tech.
With that in mind: Keep it up! Your work is of immense importance for me and others. Can't wait to read the project description.
[–]baddogesgotoheaven
Thanks a lot for chiming in, Joseph!
Happy to see the EF and Consensys taking a driver's seat too. Without its great team of developers Ethereum would be worth nothing (developers, developers, developers etc), so this is excellent news. Looking forward to Monday.

Sounds very interesting, why the secrecy?
The article mentions maybe looking for a competitive advantage, but if this is primarily infrastructure type development, I am not sure why that would be important.

why the secrecy?
Because we hoped to focus at launch on what we have done up to that point and what we are doing, in terms of elements of a roadmap, rather than just talking about getting a bunch of companies and organizations with shared interests into a room together.
It was not at all secret for any sort of competitive advantage. This group will produce specifications and reference clients, not products.

Why are people commenting like this is good news? Private Ethereum implementations don't benefit us.
If things like this succeed, look forward to nee ding licenses before you can interface with the private chain... degrees and certifications, before you can get hired working in the space... etc.
We need low barrier of entry to benefit the people. No high cost for licenses and educations that are a decade out-dated and require additional certifications.
Anyone who's interested in the technology, furthering their education, or running their business more effectively, should be able to do so at low cost, with public information.
[–]Jmlubin ********
Private Ethereum implementations don't benefit us. The public blockchain is primary for many in that group. Private permissioned versions are necessary for various uses cases and especially necessary while Ethereum grows more scalable and configurably private/confidential and this group will also assist in that regard.
In short, public Ethereum at the protocol level and at the application level will benefit enormously from the activities of this group and the activities of any group that take Ethereum seriously on which to build elements of their business.
It is possible, in the next 6 months, that we will demonstrate an application that makes use of both private and public blockchain. The future will see many, many of these. And this is one massive advantage that Ethereum has over all other blockchain systems: businesses can start where they are comfortable, and then migrate all or parts of their applications to take advantage of characteristics of the public blockchain.
Edited to remove a currently unprovable minor statement. :-)
[–]CryptoAnthony
You cannot say I am wrong, as the future is not in your control and I am stating an opinion and concern of mine. I hope it doesn't turn out how I expressed.
[–]RTylerSmith
I completely disagree with you. As an industrial private blockchain builder, I can clearly see that our private Ethereum chain is only the first step in introducing this technology. The ecosystem will evolve and we will begin to see all roads leading to Rome (ie. Public Ethereum). Private chains are useful, but they become infinitely more useful if we can tie them into the Public chain.
[–]shakedog
My understanding has always been that one of the strongest characteristic of Ethereum is that it rewards players/actors proportionally to the value they provide.
In other words, if the operators of these private chains are extracting more profits proportional to the value they create than the market is willing to bear, then competition will emerge as a race to the bottom in fees emerges.

johnlilic,"My tweet was not related to Enterprise Ethereum but rather that ConsenSys (and others) have been working across industries and sectors with Fortune 500's for nearly two years building out a variety of applications and solutions. In that time, we've seen our counterparts on the enterprise side develop some spectacular solutions including JP Morgan's Quorum https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum

Much of the work we do with enterprise clients and partners is not broadly disseminated because of things like NDA's, however we should expect to see a number of projects go public in 2017. To be clear; when we talk about 'blockchain' in the context of Fortune 500 adoption, what we're talking about is Ethereum and that will become even more apparent in the coming year. 

For those that are quick to speculate on things like ""Why are people commenting like this is good news? Private Ethereum implementations don't benefit us"", I would say that many organizations realize public Ethereum is ultimately going to be where most business processes reside and we should not dismiss the value of private blockchain ecosystems in assisting and accelerating the development and adoption of the public network- the relationship is symbiotic.

antiics,"&gt; This and continued responses here are axiomatic to ONE question- why is the price of ETH going down?

I think you think axiomatic means something different than what it actually does.

That point aside - you're essentially saying the price is going down because ""Lulz ETH Foundation. Buy ETC"". My points were trying to elucidate the fact that you're creating a false dichotomy. It's not your fault, the entire crypto community does this. When red candlesticks are about, the knives come out. No doubt when BTC eventually regresses back to $825 (before eventually seeing even higher highs in 2017, 2018, ...) people will also be doomsaying.

&gt; Let's agree that the market is having a voice here with price- as in all markets- all I am doing is interpreting it.

What you fail to account for is that the entire crypto market is as a phytoplankton in an ocean of enormous whales and sharks. There are 60 major stock exchanges in the world with a total valuation of $69 trillion (http://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-stock-exchanges-by-size/). Taking this week's all time high market capitalization of $16.5 billion means that our *entire market* is 0.0239% of the total addressable market.

The fact that we're effectively a rounding error means that our market is absolutely prone to market manipulation, conspiracy theories, cult of personality, and irrational exuberance. Using the mythical ""Market"" (capital M) as a proxy for your own personal beliefs is an emotional response; not a empirical one.

&gt; The market is giving Ethereum, The Ethereum Foundation, and Vitalik Buterin personally the middle finger.

The market is _not_ doing that. The market does not give people the middle finger. The market responds to supply and demand. The market facilitates price discovery and exchanges of goods and services. Keep in mind that the Ethereum Foundation raised $18,439,086 in September of 2014. The fact that the market cap today is $642,003,253 represents a 34x gain in 2 years. Pretty good ROI.

&gt; ... and the ground starts to open up underneath them.

What ground is opening up? Is the world coming to an end? Are institutions who are using Ethereum dissatisfied? Again your emotional appeals are hearsay.

&gt;There would have been a ton more smart contract developers if 90% didn't drop solidity like a hot potato

Citation needed.

&gt; This kind of mentality continues to show blindness in the sense that you don't know who is helping and who is there to only take advantage and use the technology for their own purposes without even a smidgen of benefit to anyone involved with Ethereum.

You mean how Quorum is *the first open source project* an institution like JPMorgan has given back to the community? https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum

The implications of banks joining the Open Source movement (finally) is so powerful and yet no one gives the Ethereum Foundation credit for getting these institutions to finally _care_ about open source.

The fact that these seeds are being planted now will provide enormous returns for the broader community in the years to come.

&gt;  Exactly what expense, burden, or development are these ""partners"" independently contributing?

Sure. Microsoft is putting engineering talent to make these networks easier to deploy so that more people have access to running and using the software. For example: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network/

Furthermore, their teams are working to provide new frameworks for trusted oracles. See Bletchley: https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md

Not to mention the work they're doing to help the security of smart contracts via the Kinakuta initiative: http://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-launches-smart-contracts-security-working-group/

All of this is *Microsoft funded* work. They are helping the community by giving tools for broader adoption. This is how open source software projects grow up and get hardened over time.

&gt; Move fast and break stuff is a stupid idea for a production environment.

Maybe...except from the onset the Ethereum Foundation has laid out a phased launch process (https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/).

Release Step One: Frontier
Release Step Two: Homestead
Release Step Three: Metropolis
Release Step Four: Serenity

We're still in Homestead. You can call it a ""production system"" if you want to, but all of the Ethereum Foundations communications since day 1 have stated this is NOT Bitcoin. Moving fast and smashing the status quo of what ""blockchain"" means to Bitcoin Maximalists is part of the ethos.

&gt; You deploy things on test nets.

You mean like Morden and Ropsten?

&gt; A fork of the mining base does not constitute 100% uptime, it constitute a huge loss of computing power.

Constitution of uptime is not something that is opinion based. The network never stopped processing transactions. Therefore, 100% uptime.

&gt; I would probably answer, to start with, ""what Foundation?"" We never hear from any Foundation. Is it a legal entity with books that show its remaining funding?

You mean like when the Foundation hosts an annual developer conference in different parts of the world with massive attendance? Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) is based in Zug, Switzerland. You can look this information up.

&gt; There is nobody holding this project together from a management or production perspective, and this experience is required to maintain a billion USD company.

You do realize that your points here are directly antithetical to the principals of a decentralized technology. You want your cake and you want to eat it too. If I chose to attack a view point without having a coherent perspective, I too could poke holes in every possible direction like you are doing. Despite your negative thoughts, it is clear that the Ethereum Foundation is doing a lot of stakeholder management while bringing on more development, more partners, and more avenues of funding.

&gt; There is nothing holding this one together to let it deserve a billion USD worth of public funds until it becomes a grown-up and acts like a grown-up.

Any what holds Bitcoin's $16 billion dollar market cap in place that's so Zuckerbergian?

&gt; This is an arena of Big Business, it isn't a land of make-believe.

Yeah, it's not a land of make believe. Meanwhile platforms like First Blood are generating valuations of many millions before even having a product. You treat this market as if it's a robust and global leader. Take a step back and gain some perspective. We're still a highly speculative, highly irrational market.

&gt;  To think you can breach your stated values and principals as a matter of experimentation is absurd

You're showing your emotions again. Let's revisit what we've already covered: research foundation, nascent technology platform, phased launch approach. Experimentation _is_ a stated value and principal of this technology. To try and paint it into something else is why your arguments are idealogical and not immersed in any real sense of reality.

&gt; What part of ""investor perspective"" as the sole driving impact on ETH price are you not understanding??

Probably the same part that focuses on the growth and adoption of the technology as a real indicator of underlying fundamentals more than price speculation.

&gt; There is no risk that is necessary unless you are a risk-taking reckless psychopath

Emotions. Psychopath? Really? Are people's 401ks and home mortgages tied into the Ethereum crypto token? Let's try and bring in a sense of scope and reality here. No one has ever stated that ETH is a meaningful, long term, safe investment. Quite the opposite; everyone in crypto knows that investments can go to zero. By the way, ETC is near it's all time low as well. No one is calling the ETC guys psychopaths.

&gt; ETC wants to hold onto something it can believe in, and can trust. Like BTC people, they care about the money, which is axiomatic to the sole answer to the singular question of ""why is ETH price going down?""

Again, please look up the definition of axiomatic. ETC folks are maximalists who believe that anything that is against the Word of Satoshi is worth tearing down. Yeah, the DAOsaster happened. Yeah, Stephan Tual sucks. Yeah, the thing raised an absurd amount of money. Yeah, there was a hard fork to thwart an attacker who exploited a smart contract. All those things are true, but how does that turn in to ""ETC is something we can believe in"" ?

ETC guys want to ""Make Ethereum Great Again"". Except they don't take into account that there are market manipulators such as Barry who have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the BTC ecosystem and see successful ETH community as a threat to that investment. Or that PoS creates an enormous threat to the entire mining infrastructure that has developed in China in the past 4 years. Propaganda machines are an amazing thing to observe if you watch with an objective perspective.

&gt; Linus is happy making 6 figures US and being a hero, working for someone else. I think you have to go down 10 layers from the top in management at Microsoft to get any lower than that salary.

ivicaa,"Reading Quorum documentation again, I am not sure if it can be called anchoring. The hash of the private transaction is published to all, but nodes not knowing the payload (which is coming via constellation) are simply ignoring it. On the other side, if it is included into a block, it could be viewed as anchoring.

https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki/Transaction-Processing

&gt; Private Transactions, however, are not executed per standard Ethereum: prior to the sender's Quorum Node propagating the Transaction to the rest of the network, it replaces the original Transaction Payload with a hash of the encrypted Payload that it receives from Constellation. Participants that are party to the Transaction will be able to replace the hash with the actual payload via their Constellation instance, whilst those Participants that are not party will only see the hash.

&gt; The result is that if a Private Transaction is sent to an Account that holds Contract code, those participants who are not party to the Transaction will simply end up skipping the Transaction, and therefore not execute the Contract code. However those participants that are party to the Transaction will replace the hash with the original Payload before calling the EVM for execution, and their StateDB will be updated accordingly.",2016-12-20 04:23:57,dbe6p7g,1,ethereum

&gt;Netanyahu was lecturing the president live on television, during a photo opportunity staged so that the two leaders could issue platitudes about the enduring bonds between their nations. That display of impudence left the president and his team feeling unusually angry. Shortly afterward, Obama's chief of staff, William Daley, called the Israeli ambassador in Washington, Michael Oren, to communicate the displeasure of the White House in a reportedly heated way. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who watched her husband battle Netanyahu in the late 1990s, also expressed anger and frustration about the prime minister within the administration.

&gt; Gates's frustration also stems from squabbling with Netanyahu over **U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies.** In an encounter in Israel in March, according to U.S. and Israeli sources, Netanyahu lectured Gates at length on the possible dangers posed to Israel by such sales, as well as by Turkey and other regional U.S. allies. **Gates, a veteran intelligence officer, resented Netanyahu's tone, and reminded him that the sales were organized in consultation with Israel and pro-Israel members of Congress.**",2016-10-29 21:11:20,d9covma,5,HillaryForPrison

The story of the 2008 financial crisis

So let’s recap the basic facts: why did we have a financial crisis in 2008? Barry Ritholtz fills us in on the history with an excellent series of articles in the Washington Post:

In 1998, banks got the green light to gamble: The Glass-Steagall legislation, which separated regular banks and investment banks was repealed in 1998. This allowed banks, whose deposits were guaranteed by the FDIC, i.e. the government, to engage in highly risky business.

Low interest rates fueled an apparent boom: Following the dot-com bust in 2000, the Federal Reserve dropped rates to 1 percent and kept them there for an extended period. This caused a spiral in anything priced in dollars (i.e., oil, gold) or credit (i.e., housing) or liquidity driven (i.e., stocks).

Asset managers sought new ways to make money: Low rates meant asset managers could no longer get decent yields from municipal bonds or Treasurys. Instead, they turned to high-yield mortgage-backed securities.

The credit rating agencies gave their blessing: The credit ratings agencies — Moody’s, S&amp;P and Fitch had placed an AAA rating on these junk securities, claiming they were as safe as U.S. Treasurys.

Fund managers didn’t do their homework: Fund managers relied on the ratings of the credit rating agencies and failed to do adequate due diligence before buying them and did not understand these instruments or the risk involved.

Derivatives were unregulated: Derivatives had become a uniquely unregulated financial instrument. They are exempt from all oversight, counter-party disclosure, exchange listing requirements, state insurance supervision and, most important, reserve requirements. This allowed AIG to write $3 trillion in derivatives while reserving precisely zero dollars against future claims.

The SEC loosened capital requirements: In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission changed the leverage rules for just five Wall Street banks. This exemption replaced the 1977 net capitalization rule’s 12-to-1 leverage limit. This allowed unlimited leverage for Goldman Sachs [GS], Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch (now part of Bank of America [BAC]), Lehman Brothers (now defunct) and Bear Stearns (now part of JPMorganChase–[JPM]). These banks ramped leverage to 20-, 30-, even 40-to-1. Extreme leverage left little room for error. By 2008, only two of the five banks had survived, and those two did so with the help of the bailout.

The federal government overrode anti-predatory state laws. In 2004, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency federally preempted state laws regulating mortgage credit and national banks, including anti-predatory lending laws on their books (along with lower defaults and foreclosure rates). Following this change, national lenders sold increasingly risky loan products in those states. Shortly after, their default and foreclosure rates increased markedly.

Compensation schemes encouraged gambling: Wall Street’s compensation system was—and still is—based on short-term performance, all upside and no downside. This creates incentives to take excessive risks. The bonuses are extraordinarily large and they continue–$135 billion in 2010 for the 25 largest institutions and that is after the meltdown.

Wall Street became “creative”: The demand for higher-yielding paper led Wall Street to begin bundling mortgages. The highest yielding were subprime mortgages. This market was dominated by non-bank originators exempt from most regulations.
Private sector lenders fed the demand: These mortgage originators’ lend-to-sell-to-securitizers model had them holding mortgages for a very short period. This allowed them to relax underwriting standards, abdicating traditional lending metrics such as income, credit rating, debt-service history and loan-to-value.

Financial gadgets milked the market: “Innovative” mortgage products were developed to reach more subprime borrowers. These include 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgages, interest-only loans, piggy-bank mortgages (simultaneous underlying mortgage and home-equity lines) and the notorious negative amortization loans (borrower’s indebtedness goes up each month). These mortgages defaulted in vastly disproportionate numbers to traditional 30-year fixed mortgages.

Commercial banks jumped in: To keep up with these newfangled originators, traditional banks jumped into the game. Employees were compensated on the basis loan volume, not quality.

Derivatives exploded uncontrollably: CDOs provided the first “infinite market”; at height of crash, derivatives accounted for 3 times global economy.

The boom and bust went global. Proponents of the Big Lie ignore the worldwide nature of the housing boom and bust. A McKinsey Global Institute report noted “from 2000 through 2007, a remarkable run-up in global home prices occurred.”

Fannie and Freddie jumped in the game late to protect their profits: Nonbank mortgage underwriting exploded from 2001 to 2007, along with the private label securitization market, which eclipsed Fannie and Freddie during the boom. The vast majority of subprime mortgages — the loans at the heart of the global crisis — were underwritten by unregulated private firms. These were lenders who sold the bulk of their mortgages to Wall Street, not to Fannie or Freddie. Indeed, these firms had no deposits, so they were not under the jurisdiction of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp or the Office of Thrift Supervision.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac market share declined. The relative market share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dropped from a high of 57 percent of all new mortgage originations in 2003, down to 37 percent as the bubble was developing in 2005-06. More than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions. The government-sponsored enterprises were concerned with the loss of market share to these private lenders — Fannie and Freddie were chasing profits, not trying to meet low-income lending goals.

It was primarily private lenders who relaxed standards: Private lenders not subject to congressional regulations collapsed lending standards. the GSEs. Conforming mortgages had rules that were less profitable than the newfangled loans. Private securitizers — competitors of Fannie and Freddie — grew from 10 percent of the market in 2002 to nearly 40 percent in 2006. As a percentage of all mortgage-backed securities, private securitization grew from 23 percent in 2003 to 56 percent in 2006.",2016-04-09 05:17:20,d1vg42a,1,politics

Furthermore, Goldman and Morgan Stanley were both allowed to become 'universal' banks with the repeal, and that status allowed them to borrow from the Fed discount window, saving them from collapse, too.

Both before and after ceding control, the only thing Fred could count in his net worth was his stock interests in the company. Nothing changes in that regard when the CEO changes.

&gt;  And if he is adding its net worth when calculating his own, why wouldn't you consider its net worth when he inherited control of the company from his father?

Because when he received control from his father, he didn't get the stock interest which means he didn't own the company, his father did. He does now own the Trump organization which means that he now adds it to his net worth. This is extremely extremely basic stuff. 

What you're suggesting is similar to suggesting that the market cap of JPMorganChase should be added to Jamie Dimon's net worth because he controls it. That's not the way net worth works. ",2016-01-28 23:40:30,czf6vpm,2,PoliticalDiscussion

It can on an emergency basis, since that is precisely what it did during the midst of the 2008 credit crisis.

Bobthewalrus1,"I'm not trying to defend JP Morgan here, but that $9B fine is a fucking lot. 

The bailout wasn't just a check written to the bank as profit. It was a $25B loan that JP Morgan paid back with $975M interest. It was a lower interest rate than the market (and the market wasn't loaning anything at that time), at around 3.2%. However, that was higher than the U.S. government's borrowing cost, which was just below 3%. That means the government had a .2% spread on the loan, which is actually a decent profit (around $50M) in that type of market. 

I'm not quite sure where you got the other $175B you mentioned though. The most I can find on the topic says that in total the banks made $650M from the $3.7T in bonds bought during QE. And since the government was actually offsetting other banks that would be buying bonds, the incremental value from QE to the banks directly would be around $250M (the incremental is from the government buying in certain situations that normal banks wouldn't). 

I can't find JP Morgans direct commissions (the article mentions $30M, but I can't tell if that refers to only the profits from the $6B loss the other division made or not), but the article ranks JP Morgan 5th in terms of revenue from the program which means they probably made less than $100M in profit (No real support for that number, but it has to be less than $130M to be the 5th most). And of that **$40M** was incremental profit directly because of the government (250/650=~40%).

Now that $40M is only direct profits from QE, but I don't think its fair to count indirect profits as these are made from the market booming do to low interest rates from QE, profits that any market participant can make. So a $9B fine definitely hurts, and we can see it by how much JP Morgans compliance costs have risen to try to prevent that from happening again (**$1.5B** in 2013 alone!)

TL;DR, JP Morgan did some shady things and absolutely deserved a fine. But to say a $9B fine is equivalent to a $0.05 fine for speeding because of TARP and QE is a bit disingenuous. Read everything if you want to know why.

Someone even made a thread on it: https://m.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/38h4ol/armadeus_the_bigger_picture_explored_part1_post/?ref=search_posts (excuse the subreddit)

Here's an excerpt of a FOIA memo from William Colby https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Colby Director of Central Intelligence:
&gt; Colby told me that profits from the prepositioned cocaine would be laundered through Al Carone, the New York mafia, and Robert Vesco, then redirected to the anti—communist effort through Colby. After discussions with Al Carone, I made the decision to bring the prepositioned cocaine into Mena airport, Mena, Arkansas. Central Intelligence has used used Mena airport on prior occasions. This time the cocaine is the tool. The trick was to ignore the law and avoid public scrutiny. we were helped in our effort by William J. Clinton and William F. Weld.

&gt; By 1984 all prepositioned cocaine had arrived at Mena airport and additional cocaine sources were secured. Cocaine was being transshipped through Hanger Four and Five, at Ilapango Airbase, El Salvador. My point man at Mena was Adler Berriman seal, (Berry Seal).

&gt; Bill Clinton has proved invaluable so far by containing the local law enforcement investigation's into the intelligence activity at Mena. Bill weld, as Assistant United States Attorney, was placed in charge of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. This was done so that Bill weld could control investigation's into Mena by federal law enforcement agencies. This placemenﬁ of weld has proved invaluable to date.

&gt; I ordered John Poindexter, Robert McFarland, and Oliver North to go outside the normal channel's and use available assets, including the mafia, to ensure the arrival of the cocaine.into Mena airport. The arrival's occurred in no small part through the effort's of personnel assigned to the National Security Agency. (NSA), and Army Security Agency. (ASA). The men and women of the NSA and ASA, blinded early warning defense satellites, and radar grids to enable the aircraft to land undetected at Mena airport. The NSA, and ASA operation's were ""SEA SPRAY.“ and ""JADE BRIDGE.""

*  In his court cases, William Hamilton was represented by several attorneys, one of whom was lawyer Elliot Richardson, formerly the United States Attorney General under President Richard Nixon.

*  Inslaw, once called the Institute for Law and Social Research, was a non-profit business created in 1974 by William Anthony Hamilton, ""a former analyst with the National Security Agency and onetime contract employee of the CIA."" Inslaw's original software product, Promis, was a database designed to handle papers and documents generated by law enforcement agencies and courts. Promis was a people-tracking program which had the power to integrate innumerable databases regardless of their languages, or regardless of their operating platforms. ""Every use of Promis in the court system is tracking people,"" explained Hamilton. ""You can rotate the file by case, defendant, arresting officer, judge, defense lawyer, and it's tracking all the names of all the people in all the cases.""

* Promis was funded almost entirely by government funds; therefore versions created prior to January 1978 were in the public domain. On January 1, 1978, amendments to the Copyright Act of 1976 took effect, automatically conferring upon Inslaw as the author of Promis five exclusive software copyright rights, none of which could be waived except by explicit, written waiver.

RAndrewOhge,"Are Big Banks Using Derivatives To Suppress Bullion Prices?

By Paul Craig Roberts - July 09, 2015
  
We have explained on a number of occasions how the Federal Reserves' agents, the bullion banks (principally JPMorganChase, HSBC, and Scotia) sell uncovered shorts (""naked shorts"") on the Comex (gold futures market) in order to drive down an otherwise rising price of gold. 

By dumping so many uncovered short contracts into the futures market, an artificial increase in ""paper gold"" is created, and this increase in supply drives down the price.

This manipulation works, because the hedge funds, the main purchasers of the short contracts, do not intend to take delivery of the gold represented by the contracts, settling instead in cash. 

This means that the banks who sold the uncovered contracts are never at risk from their inability to cover contracts in gold. 

At any given time, the amount of gold represented by the paper gold contracts (""open interest') can exceed the actual amount of physical gold available for delivery, a situation that does not occur in other futures markets.

In other words, the gold and silver futures markets are not a place where people buy and sell gold and silver. 

These markets are places where people speculate on price direction and where hedge funds use gold futures to hedge other bets according to the various mathematical formulas that they use. 

The fact that bullion prices are determined in this paper, speculative market, and not in real physical markets where people sell and acquire physical bullion, is the reason the bullion banks can drive down the price of gold and silver even though the demand for the physical metal is rising.

For example last Tuesday the US Mint announced that it was sold out of the American Eagle one ounce silver coin. 

It is a contradiction of the law of supply and demand that demand is high, supply is low, and the price is falling. 

Such an economic anomaly can only be explained by manipulation of prices in a market where supply can be created by printing paper contracts.

Obviously fraud and price manipulation is at work, but no heads roll. 

The Federal Reserve and US Treasury support this fraud and manipulation, because the suppression of precious metal prices protects the value and status of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency and prevents gold and silver from fulfilling their role as the transmission mechanism that warns of developing financial and economic troubles. 

The suppression of the rising gold price suppresses the warning signal and permits the continuation of financial market bubbles and Washington's ability to impose sanctions on other world powers that are disadvantaged by not being a reserve currency.

It has come to our attention that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives also play a role in price suppression and simultaneously serve to provide long positions for the bullion banks that disguises their manipulation of prices in the futures market.

OTC derivatives are privately structured contracts created by the secretive large banks. 

They are a paper, or derivative, form of an underlying financial instrument or commodity. 

Little is known about them. 

Brooksley Born, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation (CFTC) during the Clinton regime said, correctly, they the derivatives needed to be regulated. However, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary and Deputy Secretary Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt, all de facto agents of the big banks, convinced Congress to prevent the CFTC from regulating OTC derivatives.

The absence of regulation means that information is not available that would indicate the purposes for which the banks use these derivatives. 

When JPMorgan was investigated for its short silver position on Comex, the bank convinced the CFTC that its short position on Comex was a hedge against a long position via OTC derivatives. 

In other words, JPMorgan used its OTC derivatives to shield its attack on the silver price in the futures market.

During 2015 the attack on bullion prices has intensified, driving the prices lower than they have been for years. 

During the first quarter of this year there was a huge upward spike in the quantity of precious metal derivatives.

If these were long positions hedging the banks' Comex shorts, why did the price of gold and silver decline?

More evidence of manipulation comes from the continuing fall in the prices of gold and silver as set in paper future markets, although demand for the physical metals continues to rise even to the point that the US Mint has run out of silver coins to sell. 

Uncertainties arising from the Greek No vote increase systemic uncertainty. 

The normal response would be rising, not falling, bullion prices.

The circumstantial evidence is that the unregulated OTC derivatives in gold and silver are not really hedges to short positions in Comex but are themselves structured as an additional attack on precious metal prices.

If this supposition is correct, it indicates that seven years of bailing out the big banks that control the Federal Reserve and US Treasury at the expense of the US economy has threatened the US dollar to the extent that the dollar must be protected at all cost, including US regulatory tolerance of illegal activity to suppress gold and silver prices.

RAndrewOhge,"The Global Bankers’ Coup Coming to US with Bail-In Bill

Ellen Brown
Saturday, December 13, 2014

On December 11, 2014, the US House passed a bill repealing the Dodd-Frank requirement that risky derivatives be pushed into big-bank subsidiaries, leaving our deposits and pensions exposed to massive derivatives losses. 

The bill was vigorously challenged by Senator Elizabeth Warren; but the tide turned when Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorganChase, stepped into the ring. 

Perhaps what prompted his intervention was the unanticipated $40 drop in the price of oil. As financial blogger Michael Snyder points out, that drop could trigger a derivatives payout that could bankrupt the biggest banks. 

And if the G20’s new “bail-in” rules are formalized, depositors and pensioners could be on the hook.

The new bail-in rules were discussed in my last post here. 

They are edicts of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an unelected body of central bankers and finance ministers headquartered in the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. 

Where did the FSB get these sweeping powers, and is its mandate legally enforceable?

Those questions were addressed in an article I wrote in June 2009, two months after the FSB was formed, titled “Big Brother in Basel: BIS Financial Stability Board Undermines National Sovereignty.” 

It linked the strange boot shape of the BIS to a line from Orwell’s 1984: “a boot stamping on a human face—forever.” 

The concerns raised there seem to be materializing, so I’m republishing the bulk of that article here. 

We need to be paying attention, lest the bail-in juggernaut steamroll over us unchallenged.
 
The Shadowy Financial Stability Board

Alarm bells went off in April 2009, when the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was linked to the new Financial Stability Board (FSB) signed onto by the G20 leaders in London. 

The FSB was an expansion of the older Financial Stability Forum (FSF) set up in 1999 to serve in a merely advisory capacity by the G7 (a group of finance ministers formed from the seven major industrialized nations). 

The chair of the FSF was the General Manager of the BIS. 

The new FSB was expanded to include all G20members (19 nations plus the EU).

Formally called the “Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,” the G20 was, like the G7, originally set up as a forum merely for cooperation and consultation on matters pertaining to the international financial system. 

What set off alarms was that the new Financial Stability Board had real teeth, imposing “obligations” and “commitments” on its members; and this feat was pulled off without legislative formalities, skirting the usual exacting requirements for treaties. 

It was all done in hasty response to an “emergency.” 

Problem-reaction-solution was the slippery slope of coups.

Buried on page 83 of an 89-page Report on Financial Regulatory Reform issued by the US Obama administration was a recommendation that the FSB strengthen and institutionalize its mandate to promote global financial stability. 

It sounded like a worthy goal, but there was a disturbing lack of detail. 

What was the FSB’s mandate, what were its expanded powers, and who was in charge? 

An article in The London Guardian addressed those issues in question and answer format:

Who runs the regulator? The Financial Stability Forum is chaired by Mario Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy. The secretariat is based at the Bank for International Settlements’ headquarters in Basel, Switzerland.

Draghi was director general of the Italian treasury from 1991 to 2001, where he was responsible for widespread privatization (sell-off of government holdings to private investors). 

From 2002 to 2006, he was a partner at Goldman Sachs on Wall Street. 

He was succeeded in 2011 by Mark Carney, who also got his start at Goldman Sachs, working there for 13 years before going on to become Governor of the Bank of Canada in 2008 and Governor of the Bank of England in 2012. In 2011 and 2012, Carney attended the annual meetings of the controversial Bilderberg Group.

What will the new regulator do? 

The regulator will monitor potential risks to the economy . . . It will cooperate with the IMF, the Washington-based body that monitors countries’ financial health, lending funds if needed.

The IMF is an international banking organization that is also controversial. 

Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist for the World Bank, charged it with ensnaring Third World countries in a debt trap from which they could not escape. 

Debtors unable to pay were bound by “conditionalities” that included a forced sell-off of national assets to private investors in order to service their loans.

What will the regulator oversee? 

All ‘systemically important’ financial institutions, instruments and markets.

The term “systemically important” was not defined. 

Would it include such systemically important institutions as national treasuries, and such systemically important markets as gold, oil and food?

How will it work? 

The body will establish a supervisory college to monitor each of the largest international financial services firms. . . . It will act as a clearing house for information-sharing and contingency planning for the benefit of its members.

“Information-sharing” can mean illegal collusion. 

Would the information-sharing here include such things as secret agreements among central banks to buy or sell particular currencies, with the concomitant power to support or collapse targeted local economies?

What will the new regulator do about debt and loans? 

To prevent another debt bubble, the new body will recommend financial companies maintain provisions against credit losses and may impose constraints on borrowing.

What sort of constraints? 

The Basel Accords, imposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (also housed at the BIS) had not necessarily worked out well. 

The first Basel Accord, issued in 1998, had been blamed for inducing a recession in Japan from which that country had yet to recover; and the Second Basel Accord and its associated mark-to-market rule had been blamed for bringing on the 2008 crisis. (For more on this, see The Public Bank Solution.)

The Amorphous 12 International Standards and Codes

Most troubling, perhaps, was this vague parenthetical reference in a press release issued by the BIS, titled “Financial Stability Forum Re-established as the Financial Stability Board”:

As obligations of membership, member countries and territories commit to . . . implement international financial standards (including the 12 key International Standards and Codes) . . . .

This was not just friendly advice from an advisory board. It was a commitment to comply, so you would expect some detailed discussion concerning what those standards entailed. 

But a search of the major media revealed virtually nothing. 

The 12 key International Standards and Codes were left undefined and undiscussed. 

The FSB website listed them, but it was vague. 

The Standards and Codes covered broad areas that were apparently subject to modification as the overseeing committees saw fit. 

They included money and financial policy transparency, fiscal policy transparency, data dissemination, insolvency, corporate governance, accounting, auditing, payment and settlement, market integrity, banking supervision, securities regulation, and insurance supervision.

Take “fiscal policy transparency” as an example. 

The “Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” was adopted by the IMF Interim Committee in 1998. The “synoptic description” said:

The code contains transparency requirements to provide assurances to the public and to capital markets that a sufficiently complete picture of the structure and finances of government is available so as to allow the soundness of fiscal policy to be reliably assessed.

Members were required to provide a “picture of the structure and finances of government” that was complete enough for an assessment of its “soundness” — but an assessment by whom, and what if a government failed the test? 

Was an unelected private committee based in the BIS allowed to evaluate the “structure and function” of particular national governments and, if they were determined to have fiscal policies that were not “sound,” to impose “conditionalities” and “austerity measures” of the sort that the IMF was notorious for imposing on Third World countries? 

Suspicious observers wondered if that was how once-mighty nations were to be brought under the heel of Big Brother at last.

For three centuries, private international banking interests have brought governments in line by blocking them from issuing their own currencies and requiring them to borrow banker-issued “banknotes” instead. 

Political colonialism is now a thing of the past, but under the new FSB guidelines, nations could still be held in feudalistic subservience to foreign masters.

Consider this scenario: the new FSB rules precipitate a massive global depression due to contraction of the money supply. 

XYZ country wakes up to the fact that all of this is unnecessary – that it could be creating its own money, freeing itself from the debt trap, rather than borrowing from bankers who create money on computer screens and charge interest for the privilege of borrowing it. 

But this realization comes too late: the boot descends and XYZ is crushed into line. 

National sovereignty has been abdicated to a private committee, with no say by the voters...

RAndrewOhge,"The Success of Public Banking: Bank of North Dakota Outperforms Wall Street

WSJ Reports

NEW ECONOMIC VISIONS, SUSTAINABLE BANKING: Cooperative Banking in the Aquarian Age

While 49 state treasuries were submerged in red ink after the 2008 financial crash, one state’s bank outperformed all others and actually launched an economy-shifting new industry.  

So reports the Wall Street Journal this week, discussing the Bank of North Dakota (BND) and its striking success in the midst of a national financial collapse led by the major banks. Chester Dawson begins his November 16th article:

It is more profitable than Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has a better credit rating than J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and hasn’t seen profit growth drop since 2003. 

Meet Bank of North Dakota, the U.S.’s lone state-owned bank, which has one branch, no automated teller machines and not a single investment banker.

He backs this up with comparative data on the BND’s performance:

[I]ts total assets have more than doubled, to $6.9 billion last year from $2.8 billion in 2007. 

By contrast, assets of the much bigger Bank of America Corp. have grown much more slowly, to $2.1 trillion from $1.7 trillion in that period.

. . . Return on equity, a measure of profitability, is 18.56%, about 70% higher than those at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. . . .

Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services last month reaffirmed its double-A-minus rating of the bank, whose deposits are guaranteed by the state of North Dakota. 

That is above the rating for both Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan and among U.S. financial institutions, second only to the Federal Home Loan Banks, rated double-A-plus.

Dawson goes on, however, to credit the BND’s remarkable performance to the Bakken oil boom. Giving his article the controversial title, “Shale Boom Helps North Dakota Bank Earn Returns Goldman Would Envy: U.S.’s Lone State-Owned Bank Is Beneficiary of Fracking,” he contends:

The reason for its success? 

As the sole repository of the state of North Dakota’s revenue, the bank has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the boom in Bakken shale-oil production from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. 

In fact, the bank played a crucial part in kick-starting the oil frenzy in the state in 2008 amid the financial crisis.

That is how the Wall Street-owned media routinely write off the exceptional record of this lone publicly-owned bank, crediting it to the success of the private oil industry. 

It would be more accurate to say that the bank made the boom.

Excess Deposits Do Not Explain the BND’s Record Profits

Dawson confirms that the BND played a crucial role in kickstarting the boom and the economy, at a time when other states were languishing in recession. 

It did this by lending for critical infrastructure (roads, housing, hospitals, hotels) when other states’ banks were curtailing local lending.

But while the state itself may have reaped increased taxes and fees from the oil boom, the BND got no more out of the deal than an increase in deposits, as Dawson also confirms. 

The BND is the sole repository of state revenues by law.

Having excess deposits can hardly be the reason the BND has outdistanced even JPMorganChase and Bank of America, which also have massive excess deposits and have not turned them into loans. Instead, they have invested their excess reserves in securities.

Interestingly, the BND has also followed this practice. 

According to Standard &amp; Poor’s October 2014 credit report, it had a loan to deposit ratio in 2009 of 91%. This ratio dropped to 57.5% in 2014. 

The excess deposits have gone primarily into Treasuries, US government agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities. 

Thus the bank’s extraordinary profitability cannot be explained by an excess of deposits or an expanded loan portfolio.

Further eroding the official explanation is that the oil boom did not actually hit North Dakota until 2010. 

Yet it was the sole state to have escaped the credit crisis by the spring of 2009, when every other state’s budget had already dipped into negative territory. 

Montana, the runner-up, was in the black by the end of 2009; but it dropped into the red in March of that year and had to implement a pay freeze on state employees.

According to Standard &amp; Poor’s, the BND’s return on equity was up to 23.4% in 2009 – substantially higher than in any of the years of the oil boom that began in 2010.

The Real Reasons for Its Stellar Success

To what, then, are the remarkable achievements of this lone public bank attributable?

The answer is something the privately-owned major media have tried to sweep under the rug: the public banking model is simply more profitable and efficient than the private model. 

Profits, rather than being siphoned into offshore tax havens, are recycled back into the bank, the state and the community.

The BND’s costs are extremely low: no exorbitantly-paid executives; no bonuses, fees, or commissions; only one branch office; very low borrowing costs; and no FDIC premiums (the state rather than the FDIC guarantees its deposits).

These are all features that set publicly-owned banks apart from privately-owned banks. 

Beyond that, they are safer for depositors, allow public infrastructure costs to be cut in half, and provide a non-criminal alternative to a Wall Street cartel caught in a laundry list of frauds.

Dawson describes some other unique aspects of the BND’s public banking model:

It traditionally extends credit, or invests directly, in areas other lenders shun, such as rural housing loans.

. . . [R]etail banking accounts for just 2%-3% of its business. The bank’s focus is providing loans to students and extending credit to companies in North Dakota, often in partnership with smaller community banks.

Bank of North Dakota also acts as a clearinghouse for interbank transactions in the state by settling checks and distributing coins and currency. . .

The bank’s mission is promoting economic development, not competing with private banks. 

“We’re a state agency and profit maximization isn’t what drives us,” President Eric Hardmeyer said.

. . . It recently started offering mortgages to individuals in the most underserved corners of the state. But Mr. Hardmeyer dismisses any notion the bank could run into trouble with deadbeat borrowers. “We know our customers,” he said. “You’ve got to understand the conservative nature of this state. Nobody here is really interested in making subprime loans.”

The Downsides of a Boom

The bank’s mission to promote economic development could help explain why its return on equity has actually fallen since the oil boom hit in 2010. 

The mass invasion by private oil interests has put a severe strain on the state’s infrastructure, forcing it to muster its resources defensively to keep up; and the BND is in the thick of that battle.

In an August 2011 article titled “North Dakota’s Oil Boom is a Blessing and a Curse”, Ryan Holeywell writes that virtually all major infrastructure in the boom cities and counties is strained or exhausted. 

To shore up its infrastructure needs, the state has committed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

Meanwhile, it is trying to promote industries other than oil and gas, such as companies involved with unmanned aircraft, manufacturing associated with wind energy equipment, and data centers; but the remoteness of the western part of the state, along with the high cost of labor, makes doing business there complicated and expensive.

Hydrofracking, which has been widely attacked as an environmental hazard, is not as bad in North Dakota as in other states, since the process takes place nearly two miles underground; but it still raises significant environmental concerns. 

In 2011, the state levied $3 million in fines against 20 oil companies for environmental violations. 

It also undertook a review of industry regulations and was in the process of doubling its oil field inspectors.

The greatest stresses from the oil industry, however, involve the shortage of housing and the damage to the county road system, which in many places consists of two-lane gravel and dirt roads. Drilling a new well requires more than 2,000 truck trips, and the heavy rigs are destroying the roads. Fixing them has been estimated to require an investment of more than $900 million over the next 20 years.

These are external costs imposed by the oil industry that the government has to pick up. All of it requires financing, and the BND is there to provide the credit lines.

Lighting a Fire under Legislators

What the Bank of North Dakota has done to sustain its state’s oil boom, a publicly-owned bank could do for other promising industries in other states. 

But Dawson observes that no other state has yet voted to take up the challenge, despite a plethora of bills introduced for the purpose. 

Legislators are slow to move on innovations, unless a fire is lit under them by a crisis or a mass popular movement.

We would be better off sparking a movement than waiting for a crisis. 

The compelling data in Dawson’s Wall Street Journal article, properly construed, could add fuel to the flames.

marshyme13,"
In 2006 or so, JPMorganChase bought a bunch of unsafe loans (loans that people weren't going to be able to pay back, making the bank lose money).

Then, the review department was strong-armed into saying these unsafe loans were high-quality ""grade A"" loans.

Alayne, the lady being interviewed, was part of the review department. She saw that these were unsafe loans and tried to stop JPMC from selling them as Grade A. She was yelled at, her coworkers were yelled at, eventually other people on the review department gave up and certified the loans as Grade A.  

Alayne was fired, and JPMC was able to start selling the loans, because no one else knew they were bad. This is fraud.

The housing market crashed in 2008 because of unsafe loans (like the ones JPMC lied about), JPMC helped cause this crazy by lying about and selling bad loans.

US government officials investigated, were lied to and slowed down by JPMC lawyers, officials, workers, anyone that was involved. Hudson, the main investigator, helped cover it up by being slow and investigating poorly, and giving press conferences saying ""we're doing our best"" but not actually punishing JPMC. 

Eventually, JPMC agreed to ""admit guilt"" to the US government and pay a $6 billion fine, instead of going to court. The US officials said no, so JPMC said ""well what if I pay a THIRTEEN billion dollar fine"" and the US investigators agreed (corruption and shady deals). It was actually a $9 billion fine, because $4bil was for compensation to the homeowners with mortgages, which JPMC didn't really do.

Alayne, the lady being interviewed, was there when JPMC committed the fraud of lying about the quality of the loans. When she was fired, she had to sign a nondisclosure agreement, to protect the secrets of JPMC where she worked (that's normal). US government investigators contacted her and interviewed her many times over the past 8 years, but as I said above they did very little, and never fully punished JPMC for the bad acts. 

Now there is another ongoing investigation, she doesn't know how that will go, and she finally broke her nondisclosure agreement and spilled the whole story to The Rolling Stone in an interview.


Tldr: JPMC lies about loans, Alayne is fired for trying to stop them, housing market crashes, government ""investigates"", story and corruption are covered up, JPMC pays a small fine to cover it up more, Alayne wasn't supposed to say anything, now she's spilled the beans.

RAndrewOhge,"Big Banks Hit with Monster $250 Billion Lawsuit in Housing Crisis

Ellen Brown

For years, homeowners have been battling Wall Street in an attempt to recover some portion of their massive losses from the housing Ponzi scheme.

But progress has been slow, as they have been outgunned and out-spent by the banking titans. 

In June, however, the banks may have met their match, as some equally powerful titans strode onto the stage. Investors led by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and PIMCO, the world’s largest bond-fund manager, have sued some of the world’s largest banks for breach of fiduciary duty as trustees of their investment funds.

The investors are seeking damages for losses surpassing $250 billion.

That is the equivalent of one million homeowners with $250,000 in damages suing at one time. 

The defendants are the so-called trust banks that oversee payments and enforce terms on more than $2 trillion in residential mortgage securities.

They include units of Deutsche Bank AG, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, HSBC Holdings PLC, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp.

Six nearly identical complaints charge the trust banks with breach of their duty to force lenders and sponsors of the mortgage-backed securities to repurchase defective loans. 

Why the investors are only now suing is complicated, but it involves a recent court decision on the statute of limitations.

Why the trust banks failed to sue the lenders evidently involves the cozy relationship between lenders and trustees.

The trustees also securitized loans in pools where they were not trustees. If they had started filing suit demanding repurchases, they might wind up sued on other deals in retaliation.

Better to ignore the repurchase provisions of the pooling and servicing agreements and let the investors take the losses—better, at least, until they sued. 

Beyond the legal issues are the implications for the solvency of the banking system itself.

Can even the largest banks withstand a $250 billion iceberg?

The sum is more than 40 times the $6 billion “London Whale” that shook JPMorganChase to its foundations. 

Who Will Pay – the Banks or the Depositors? 

The world’s largest banks are considered “too big to fail” for a reason.

The fractional reserve banking scheme is a form of shell game, which depends on “liquidity” borrowed at very low interest from other banks or the money market.

When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008, triggering a run on the money market, the whole interconnected shadow banking system nearly went down with it. 

Congress then came to the rescue with a taxpayer bailout, and the Federal Reserve followed with its quantitative easing fire hose.

But in 2010, the Dodd Frank Act said there would be no more government bailouts.

Instead, the banks were to save themselves with “bail ins,” meaning they were to recapitalize themselves by confiscating a portion of the funds of their creditors – including not only their shareholders and bondholders but the largest class of creditor of any bank, their depositors. 

Theoretically, deposits under $250,000 are protected by FDIC deposit insurance.

But the FDIC fund contains only about $47 billion – a mere 20% of the Black Rock/PIMCO damage claims.

Before 2010, the FDIC could borrow from the Treasury if it ran short of money.

But since the Dodd Frank Act eliminates government bailouts, the availability of Treasury funds for that purpose is now in doubt. 

When depositors open their online accounts and see that their balances have shrunk or disappeared, a run on the banks is likely. And since banks rely on each other for liquidity, the banking system as we know it could collapse.

The result could be drastic deleveraging, erasing trillions of dollars in national wealth. 

Phoenix Rising 

Some pundits say the global economy would then come crashing down.

But in a thought-provoking March 2014 article called “American Delusionalism, or Why History Matters,” John Michael Greer disagrees. 

He notes that historically, governments have responded by modifying their financial systems:

Massive credit collapses that erase very large sums of notional wealth and impact the global economy are hardly a new phenomenon . . . but one thing that has never happened as a result of any of them is the sort of self-feeding, irrevocable plunge into the abyss that current fast-crash theories require.

The reason for this is that credit is merely one way by which a society manages the distribution of goods and services. . . . A credit collapse . . . doesn’t make the energy, raw materials, and labor vanish into some fiscal equivalent of a black hole; they’re all still there, in whatever quantities they were before the credit collapse, and all that’s needed is some new way to allocate them to the production of goods and services.

This, in turn, governments promptly provide. 

In 1933, for example, faced with the most severe credit collapse in American history, Franklin Roosevelt temporarily nationalized the entire US banking system, seized nearly all the privately held gold in the country, unilaterally changed the national debt from “payable in gold” to “payable in Federal Reserve notes” (which amounted to a technical default), and launched a  series of other emergency measures.  

The credit collapse came to a screeching halt, famously, in less than a hundred days. Other nations facing the same crisis took equally drastic measures, with similar results. . . .

Faced with a severe crisis, governments can slap on wage and price controls, freeze currency exchanges, impose rationing, raise trade barriers, default on their debts, nationalize whole industries, issue new currencies, allocate goods and services by fiat, and impose martial law to make sure the new economic rules are followed to the letter, if necessary, at gunpoint.

Again, these aren’t theoretical possibilities; every one of them has actually been used by more than one government faced by a major economic crisis in the last century and a half.

That historical review is grounds for optimism, but confiscation of assets and enforcement at gunpoint are still not the most desirable outcomes. 

Better would be to have an alternative system in place and ready to implement before the boom drops.

The Better Mousetrap 

North Dakota has established an effective alternative model that other states might do well to emulate. 

In 1919, the state legislature pulled its funds out of Wall Street banks and put them into the state’s own publicly-owned bank, establishing financial sovereignty for the state. 

The Bank of North Dakota has not only protected the state’s financial interests but has been a moneymaker for it ever since. 

On a national level, when the Wall Street credit system fails, the government can turn to the innovative model devised by our colonial forebears and start issuing its own currency and credit—a power now usurped by private banks but written into the US Constitution as belonging to Congress. 

The chief problem with the paper scrip of the colonial governments was the tendency to print and spend too much. 

The Pennsylvania colonists corrected that systemic flaw by establishing a publicly-owned bank, which lent money to farmers and tradespeople at interest. 

To get the funds into circulation to cover the interest, some extra scrip was printed and spent on government services. 

The money supply thus expanded and contracted naturally, not at the whim of government officials but in response to seasonal demands for credit. 

The interest returned to public coffers, to be spent on the common weal. 

The result was a system of money and credit that was sustainable without taxes, price inflation or government debt – not to mention without credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, central bank manipulation, slicing and dicing of mortgages, rehypothecation in the repo market, and the assorted other fraudulent schemes underpinning our “systemically risky” banking system today.

Relief for Homeowners?

Will the BlackRock/PIMCO suit help homeowners?

Not directly.

But it will get some big guns on the scene, with the ability to do all sorts of discovery, and the staff to deal with the results. 

Fraud is grounds for rescission, restitution and punitive damages.

The homeowners may not have been parties to the pooling and servicing agreements governing the investor trusts, but if the whole business model is proven to be fraudulent, they could still make a case for damages.

shapu,"It had very little to do with the 2008 crisis.  But the issue, now that banks are heavily tied to investments, is one of a possibility of failure.  If, say, JPMorganChase, which has a retail banking side, makes a series of bad bets and goes under, what happens to depositors' accounts?  They're all insured, up to a certain amount, but that puts the onus on taxpayers to foot the bill via the FDIC.  There's a small amount of a moral hazard there.

But if the investment and retail operations are completely separated, then if the investment bank goes under, it doesn't affect consumer banking at all.",2014-07-18 06:44:52,cj0ejgz,6,politics
[deleted],"You are still avoiding my question.

If you purchase a stake in a company for $75 and at the end of the year that company has earned $5 attributable to your share, does that seem like egregious profits? Yes or no?

&gt;That's not for me to decide. That's up to the workers.

Why should the workers get to decide how much is to much? They don't own the company. They didn't put their own money at risk to build it. Workers trade their time and skills for a paycheck. They come to an agreement to trade x amount of time for y amount of dollars. Why should they get to decide when they feel profits are to large? Do you have a reason supported by any kind of logic?

&gt;If there are 100 employees and the CEO is taking 1,000,000 times what the worker is getting, you don't think taking half that and dividing amongst the workers wouldn't be noticeable?

Come back from lala land. Want to come up with something a little more realistic?

First, the USA was the only country that had a Glass Steagall style regulation. Second, combining investment and commercial banking isn't any more dangerous than separating them. Of the banks that did better in the crash a lot of them were mixed banks. 

BOA and JPMorganChase were the ones supporting the rest of the industry, and they wouldn't be allowed under glass steagall.

The real issue is 1) Size and 2) the leverage banks were allowed to take. Glass Steagal didn't do anything to directly limit either of those two factors.

Now for Bitcoin itself, all these arguments have probably been made in this comment section.

Inefficient - in power, in updating the blockchain.

The Blockchain itself - who updates it after all the coins were mined? It was originally designed to not be a problem because of moores law acting on CPUs. ASIC blew that figure out of the water, so who will buy a bunch of ASICs and leave them running when the coins are mined, or the return is nothing? That will mean exchanges have to pay you to do it, because who else would?

User Friendly - It's not user friendly, not even remotely user friendly, the average person can't even understand the concept let alone the program, this is a massive issue. Add in multiple wallets, exchanges, encryption, even the word hacker. People jump ship.

Competition - JPMorganChase is making their Bitcoin killer. I've suggested this was coming and been laughed at. All any bank has to do is make a ""Legal, non-criminal, no blackmarket, user friendly alternative! with all the same features as a bitcoin!"" and they'd hook 99% of idiots. Idiots want simple to understand, legal, tax satisfying currency. Not complicated freedom based currency.

Dream vs Reality - The current bitcoin fanatic sees bitcoin as literal gold. They don't see it as a computer program that could get slapped to the side by any altcoin, which it will, probably very soon. They also see it as a tool for embracing freedom, average joe doesn't give a fuck about that, they're happy polishing their chains in the corner, being thrown meager scraps to survive.

I just don't see anything in Bitcoin that couldn't be replaced, out-marketed, ridiculed to the point of social unacceptability (remember, Krusty lost huge in the Bitcoin market).

Gnome_Sane,"&gt;I am going to start by going into more detail about what a SNAP/EBT card is. I think that may clear up some issues.

I actually think I have a good handle on the difference between the two cards. What didn't make sense to me was that the SNAP card can't be used to buy TP or soap or other basic household items. SO I assume that is what the EBT card is for... or is the system set up so it doesn't take these things into account at all?

&gt;maybe you have a rich uncle

I can't really identify with such a lucky life, but again - I think I understand the difference between the EBT and Snap card.

&gt;All EBT cards are tied to a case that includes name (printed on the card), a case number (printed on the card), as well as other information like address and phone number (not printed on the card, but rather in your case file). These cards are linked to a permanent account that has money placed in it every month, based on the benefit programs the client is receiving. These are not throwaway cards, like gift cards, but cards linked to a permanent account, like credit or debit cards.

I really appreciate the response, but noticed you don't use citations. Part of the confusion to me seems like if the card has a person's name on it - how can it be sold? Is it illegal to ask for ID?

&gt;In theory, all EBT purchases should have the employee at the point of service checking ID against the name on the card. This would apply to people buying groceries with an EBT card that contained SNAP. It would also apply to a client swiping their card at a state-subsidized child-care facility (using an open child care benefit). In practice, this doesn't always happen

This doesn't happen anywhere for any normal credit cards or debit cards... letalone a SNAP EBT or TAMF EBT. I've also searched for images of a SNAP card or EBT card to see if there is a name, but they always look blank.

When selling, you can verify any card by:

PLJVYF,"""Bureaucracy"" is something frustrated people complain about. An uncaring, indifferent person with power followed a rule strictly rather than give special treatment, and your frustrated friend doesn't even understand what the rule is.

""Bureau"" is french for ""office"", and ""Bureaucracy"" means literally, ""rule by offices"" -- a system of rule based on position in an organization. Bureaucracy means an organization that is hierarchical (a chain of command) and has professional staff (chosen for their skills, not as a favor or by elections). So the DMV is a bureaucracy, but so is McDonalds. So is AT&amp;T. So is JPMorganChase. Except for certain free form businesses (tech startups, small charities), most companies are bureaucracies. This is why Dilbert comics work -- they involve personalities rebelling against impersonal structure and rules.

Bureaucracy is the only way to do things on a BIG scale -- all over the place, all at once, with any kind of consistency. Unfortunately, this means that bureaucracies are often slow to change, and when they make mistakes the results can be huge and widespread -- see mass food contamination outbreaks from industrial farming (a combined bureaucracy of commercial slaughterhouses and government inspectors).

SweetMexicanJesus,"&gt; How can stock still exist for a company that ceased existing in 2008?

Because the assets are probably still winding their way through bankruptcy court, leaving a (ridiculously small) chance that ""common"" stockholders will still see some return after all the secured creditors, bondholders, and any ""preferred"" classes of stockholder have been paid off.

As a relevant example, Washington Mutual's stock bounced around for years under the ticker symbol WAMUQ, and is a rare example of a ""bankrupt"" company for which shareholders actually saw a return, since WAMU had a lot of real estate holdings, and its assets actually exceeded the liabilities it was left with after the bulk of the assets were ~~given~~ sold to JPMorganChase. It's currently trading under the symbol WMIH after a change of name to WMI Holdings, Inc.

VW owns Seat, Skoda, Suzuki, ever driven one? I admire Bugattis, do you like Audis or Ducattis or Bentleys? VW. Henry Ford received a Nazi medal for distinguished foreigners, if you're American you might have gone to school on one of their bus chassis, and you definitely own something that got shipped in a container pulled by a Ford truck. Chase bank froze European Jewish accounts and sold marks for the Third Reich, and if you don't bank with them, some business you bought something off probably has their accounts with JPMorganChase. Read books? [Here's a list of assets owned by Bertelsmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Bertelsmann), a published company that produced Nazi propaganda.

This said and done, my point is not that everybody should boycott all these companies. For starts, all the people in all the companies that assisted the Nazi regime are most definitely all long gone by now. Not all the people working in those companies will have supported Nazism. To direct vitriol towards absolutely every individual without question in those firms would be similar to hating contemporary Germans for the actions of their forefathers -- baseless and stupid. However those companies' success today was helped by the capital profited from their Nazi success, it's history you can't avoid. In the US, forefathers killed and relocated the natives for their own Lebensraum; what are Americans going to do, feel guilty with every step they take? Just accept that history is ugly, and the winners of it are often the dirtiest.

The companies in question, Hugo Boss etc., were populated with *people* who balanced profiteering against disapproval of Nazism and chose the former. My point is ultimately that when people and the companies they make decisions for have the opportunity to profit from something, they'll do so, regardless of the moral consequences.

And, due to the nature of capital-financed business, this is a property of our economy that we can't escape from. Have you ever drank an ice-cold Fanta on a sweltering summer's day? It was invented for the Third Reich because Coca-Cola couldn't get any cola syrup imported past the trade restrictions. Making a buck off being a bastard is a trait of humanity and our society that's necessarily shoved down our throats every day (presuming we're aware of it).

We went to the damn Moon on the back of a Saturn V rocket, designed by a Nazi who used concentration camp workers to build V-2s that killed London civilians. One giant leap for mankind, propelled by its repulsiveness.

I want to shake people who keep their savings in currency by their shoulders. Precious metals, antiques, memorabilia etc appreciate faster than your average savings and investment rates anyway.

ModernDemagogue,"Actually, he uses more public services than pretty much anyone else except those richer than he. A poor person has no use for the military; the military acts in America's economic interests, which basically means our corporations of which he is probably an investor in a lot of, and therefore gets the increased profits, and benefits from a stable investment climate. This is about 700 billion of the US budget; and don't forget, that 700 billion goes in contracts to large defense providers which the wealthy own shares in, and make a profit off of every tank, bomb, plane, and gun built.

Another huge chunk of the US budget is interest payments to people who own US debt. Aside from foreign governments, who do own some of our debt but not nearly as much as the right would like you to believe, wealthy individuals own a huge amount of US debt, either directly, or indirectly through their ownership of financial institutions. In 2011 we spent $454 billion financing our debt. We paid $454 billion directly, to the wealthy people of the world. I don't see the bottom 47% owning shares in Goldman Sachs, JPMorganChase, and hedgefunds. Do you?

So that knocks out a good 60% of the budget (ignoring Social Security and Medicare which are funded separately), which simply does not fucking benefit the poor in the slightest. 1.2 trillion in straight up payments to the wealthy.

Now on a local level; things like the Cops are there to keep him and his family safe; he would get much better treatment in an emergency; whether a crime, a fire, or a disaster. Case in point, Lower Manhattan gets taken care of during Sandy, other places have to wait. Money talks. Resources are there for the rich and powerful. Power, water, parks, hell, I bet he has more than one care to use on the roads and doesn't have to worry about using public transportation.

Even things which apparently directly benefit the lower class actually benefit him; Social Security is capped at 114k meaning it is incredibly regressive, the middle class is basically paying for the retirements of everyone in society, but this means that corporations don't have to pay as high salaries, or benefits, or pensions, because people's retirements are being government subsidized so they don't plan for it on their own as much, and these lower wages result in higher profits for the wealthy who own stock in these companies. Food Stamps, Welfare, Public Housing, all of these have the same benefit to the rich; they act as subsidies on labor costs, and they also incentivize giving birth to children which increases the supply of labor and further depresses labor costs. And even these all have other ways of directly benefitting the wealthy, such as contracts for the administration and distribution of welfare and food stamps, contracts for building public housing, for providing services. It's a corporate feeding frenzy.

I can keep going. It is very, very difficult to find a federal government program which does not benefit the wealthy more than it benefits the poor, so the argument that Varney is not the recipient of a grossly disproportionate amount of the benefits of government spending is just wrong onits face.

And because he is the one that benefits, not just in all the ways I've mentioned above, but in the most fundamental and critical way, that all this government spending is what allows him to have a high paying job where he doesn't have to do very much difficult work; he just gets to sit there and talk, what is fair for him to pay, is indeed, much higher than what he pays now. But for the government, a man who lived as he does, who makes the statements he does, but is as weak and fat and incapable of defending himself as he is with no discernable skills of intrinsic value, but for the government, a man like that would be dead.

Manfromporlock,"A free market is where many businesses compete to sell goods, to hire workers, to rent land, and so on, while many workers compete for jobs and consumers compete for goods. 

Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations was the great description of the free market. *When he wrote,* laissez-faire would, most of the time, result in a free market. Thus the connection between the free market and laissez-faire.

Today, though, technology has changed; the characteristic institution of our economy is not the free market but the large organization (not a million small farms but Monsanto, Cargill and ADM; not a million small banks but JPMorganChase and Bank of America; etc. etc. etc.).

And laissez-faire leads, all too often, to letting these big companies have their way with us. 

We've known this for more than a century; the Sherman Anti-trust Act (1890) was a recognition that government interference was needed to keep the free market (which we like) from becoming concentrated private power (which we don't).

And that private power *loves* to make us confuse the two, which is why so many people think ""free market"" and ""laissez-faire"" are the same thing.

You're welcome.  But you see how the full ""story"" and explanation is necessary.  Had I told you the short version: *""I worked for a couple of years as a teller &amp; teller supervisor at a small bank in Podunk, USA.""* but done it *without* an explanation of what that really all entailed... you would have laughed it off and said: *""LOL, this peon can't know anything.""* Had I even added that I read a lot of books on banking, that probably wouldn't have done much to convince you either (and who knows, maybe you're still not convinced, nusuth.)

Conversely, had someone else told you they had a degree (!) in Economics (!!) from Yale University (!!!), and then worked a six-figure plus job as an investment banker (!!!!) for the giant JPMorganChase (!!!!!) in New York City (!!!!!!) -- then you would likely give them a LOT more credence.

Even though they would actually be the equivalent of the guy tightening a couple of bolts on the gas tanks of an assembly line, whereas I was the guy building entire cars from start to finish.

Of course there will be plenty of people who even after reading the above posts would STILL say: *""Ah, he doesn't know squat. My professor (!) and textbook (!!) told me the 10x multiplier... yada yada.""*

&gt;It is amazing how unaware people are of what the banking system is doing, thanks largely to the theatrics put up by the academics/politics.

Well, there ARE some fields (general mathematics, physics, engineering) where a study of the theory IS solid, tested, and critically important to understand what is going on.

That ""credibility"" of the hard sciences is then transferred over to other fields. And it is not just a coincidence, academics in those other ""soft science"" fields activity try to emulate the data &amp; equation aspect of physics (there is even a term for this, and [""physics envy""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_envy) is a very REAL phenomenon, and a very real problem).

Add in then that as students, the soft science people intermix with the hard science people -- and at that period of time, while they are undergrads, all any of them really have is the ""book learning"".  The engineering students really haven't (yet) engaged in all that much actual real-world construction; and the same with the physics and even chemistry &amp; biology students; at most they have done some small-scale ""lab experiments"" (most of which are pre-programmed things that really are not ""experiments"" at all, but rather more like a ""follow the cooking recipe step by step and make certain you get the expected outcome"").  So when they intermingle with each other, the ""soft science"" students SEEM to be engaged in the same kinds of activities and learning as the ""hard science"" students -- mostly bookwork, theories, equation-shuffling, and an occasional small-scale demonstration/experiment that is taken as ""proof"".

So it all *seems* to make sense.  See [Richard Feyman talking about ""pseudo-science""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtMX_0jDsrw) or his [speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvfAtIJbatg) / [essay about ""cargo cult science"" (PDF)](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/3043/1/CargoCult.pdf).

What is often forgotten is that a lot of total nonsense has been taught in the same way: everything from the [four humours of Hippocrates/Galen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_humours) (which survived as a medical theory for centuries upon centuries, with lots of ""confirming"" physical evidence -- the body after all really DID seem to have four distinct ""biles/fluids"" each a different color, and likewise with the four ""temperaments""), to other things like Astrology, Phrenology, Freudian Psychology, etc. -- they were all quite ""plausible"" theories that did seem to match the evidence (especially if you fell into one or more of the [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) traps).

[deleted],"&gt;No one seems to care that Obama has been so ineffectual. They don't care that the country is falling apart. No improvement, no positive change, no hope. No one cares.

I don't think that is true **at all**; in fact the opposite, most people realize that the country is in the shitter, **and they care... there just isn't squat they can do about it.**

The problem is that despite the GOP's demonization of Obama, he is NOT seen as the *primary* cause (nor -- despite the ravings of Democrats -- is his predecessor Bush blamed, nor indeed is even Washington D.C.)... rather most people see the problem as being the BANKS, chiefly the so called ""Too Big To Fail Banks""; if Obama and Washington are seen to be at fault it is chiefly in that they refuse to prosecute fraud and break up the big (criminal) banking cartel in the form of the TBTF (and alas, not as Ron Paul would have it, the Federal Reserve, most people still don't even understand what ""the Fed"" even is).

The accompanying problem then for the GOP and it's candidate Romney... is that the public doesn't see them as likely to do anything DIFFERENT than Obama in regards to the TBTF banks.  Would Romney prosecute the ""banksters""?  Would he break up the TBTF banks?

It certainly doesn't seem likely.  THAT doesn't seem to be anywhere on the radar screen of EITHER party.

And that leads the general public to be apathetic.

In fact, it is entirely possible that the general public will not only see Romney as ""nearly identical"" to Obama in regards to ~~RomneyCare~~ OOPS I meant ~~RObamneyCare~~ Dangitall, I mean OBAMAcare...

But it is pretty darned likely that (and here is where the Dem's ""Bain Attack &amp; Tax Evader Attack"" hits home) given his ""business/banking/financier/capitalist"" background, Romney will be seen as MORE of the ""establishment problem"" than even Obama (who while failing to prosecute/breakup the banks, and pretty much acting as their ""patsy""... at least he isn't ONE of the proverbial ""banksters"").

In Romney, the public may perceive that the GOP may as well have nominated Jamie Dimon, or Lloyd Blankfein, as they will see ""Bain Capital"" as not all that different from JPMorganChase, or GoldmanSachs (keep in mind that to most of the electorate ""banking/finance"" is all a mystery, all they know is that banks were at the center of the housing bubble/crash and remain at the center of the foreclosure mess &amp; are perceived as being the underlying cause of the current malaise).

**So, given a choice between two candidates they perceive as A) a ""bankster patsy"" and B) a ""bankster"", can you really expect the public to be anything BUT apathetic?**

daveshow07,"&gt; Banks are constrained by their ability to extend their loan portfolio to borrowers who are likely to pay them back while minimizing the risks of default. If they don't have enough of those borrowers, they don't get that revenue stream.

I agree, but I argue that other banks and healthy borrowers will be in a position to borrow more and seeing as the banks have more money to lend, they'd likely extend larger loan offers for similar or lower interest rates to these borrowers, because these borrowers themselves would be safer investments than past-defaulted or first time borrowers. Not to mention defaulted borrowers probably won't be getting any loans for the next 10 years anyway. However, I completely understand your point. If there aren't enough borrowers, they can't get the revenue stream, plain and clear, and I agree with that. But that underscores the value of a bank, they diversify and create loan products the leverage money and considering they have a profit motive, they will certainly find a way to leverage that money.

&gt; Who gives loans to unemployed people? That's a big gamble, and it requires high interest rate loans to compensate for the risk of default. Once again, demand suffers.

This is on a case by case basis. What if I have 10 years experience in restaurant management, and became unemployed (not terminated for whatever reason) within the last 4 months? I would have the experience necessary to qualify for the loan. Turns out, Those 4 months I'v spent researching and creating an excellent business plan because it was my plan all along to start my own restaurant, and I needed those 4 months to solidify everything. I have all my ducks in a row and I qualify for a loan. Again, it entirely depends on the nature and loan products of the bank and the nature of the borrower. To which I would again say, they're a bank, they need to lend money to make money, and if they have all of this money, they'll find a way invest it.

&gt; flooding the market with supply in a weak demand market usually isn't wise for the short to medium term. 

I suppose I should have made my thought a little more clear because I think you took my statement to mean purchasing more property *and building new housing stock.* However, I meant more along the lines of rental conversion. Purchasing bank-owned properties and converting them to rental properties more specifically. If I can buy a $100,000 house for $30,000 and I appraised $30,000 more in rehab costs, I spent $60,000 on a small house that I can now rent to a family for xxxx dollars, which covers the mortgage and taxes. Eventually, when the housing market has stabilized and rebounded, I can just as easily sell the house, which by then will have gained value. This is of course, assuming this landlord is at least somewhat knowledgeable about the local real estate market demand. But again, if I'm a bank, and I see that this landlord has already owned 6 properties for several years and wants to purchase more properties to rent, it's a much less risky investment than it is to a first-time home buyer. Not to mention it is likely a smaller loan as well. I don't believe Japan's issue is a reasonable comparison to make considering the different nature of our geographies, consumer demographics and cultures. 

&gt; I'm not saying every single individual and business has stopped borrowing, just the overall use of credit is extremely low due to default, uncertainty, lack of jobs, and a lack of clearly good investments.

I agree 100%. But this will change as banks start lending again and as consumer confidence returns.

&gt; I don't make my financial decisions based upon the health of the banking sector. The Federal Reserve has made sure that banks have all the ammo they need to lend, they just don't have enough good borrowers walking through their doors to grow in a healthy way.

I agree. 

But Investors make those decisions. Whoever manages a 401k or other investment portfolio *does* make their decisions based on market sector performance. More confident investments means increased wealth for the investor (both business and individual consumers alike) and every single business that has a portfolio of investments will see the value of this portfolio increase, increasing the value of the company, against which they can borrow and/or spend. 

For instance, you typically see stock prices fluctuate one way or another around news or financial statement releases. JP Morgan released [this financial statement on July 13th.](http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=691649) [That same day, the stock shot up $2.08 from the close the day before because the results were better than expected in some areas of the business](http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1344369600000&amp;chddm=7692&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NYSE:JPM&amp;ntsp=0) This performance makes it a stronger investment and whichever investors (companies and individuals alike) held shares on that day, made a nice return in a single day. It's the job of investment bankers to move money around into situations like this so that the bank makes a gain on the money, again, leveraging their resources. (A super basic illustration: if I had a portfolio with only 10,000 shares of JPM that I bought at 34.04 ((a pittance for most major corporate investment portfolios btw)), and sold the next day at 36.12... $361,200-$340,400 =$20,800... I made a little over a 6% profit on that trade alone (minus commission), which I can reinvest into another company and repeat the process. 

I agree with you that there is certainly less demand from healthy individual borrowers, but a major sector of the banking business is business to business transactions and lending. Making gains in these sectors offsets at least some of the losses in the individual consumer sector of the business, strengthening the banking institution, who will ultimately lend more to individual consumers once again when the individual consumer loan market stabilizes. 

And all of this is why I believe the banks will still find other ways to lend or invest their money, even when there are less individual borrowers walking through their doors. :D This post turned into a novel. I apologize, but I really am enjoying this dialogue.

DisregardMyPants,"&gt;That sounds true but it's really not. There are hundreds of brands of beer, but most of the ones you are likely to buy at the supermarket are owned by [1] inbev. 

And yet you have a choice not to, hence the ability to boycott. Craft breweries *not* owned by inbev have made a remarkably strong resurgence lately. They are available in virtually any liquor store, most bars, and most grocery stores.

&gt;There are many brands of automobiles but the Ford Motor company owns (from memory because I can't find a nice list) Ford, Lincoln, Ashton Martin, Jagaur, and part of Mazda. 

And yet you don't have to buy any of those and have many alternative options.

&gt;There are many banks out in the marketplace but [2] JPMorganChase owns many of the ones you know. 

And yet you don't have to buy any of those and have many alternative options.

&gt;There are a few television manufacturers, but not only does Samsung lead the market with a 25% share, they are the leading flat panel manufacturer and if you are using any sort of flatpanel screen (the glass, not the electronics), you are likely to be using one made from their factories - handhelds, monitors, TVs. 

And yet you don't have to buy any of those and have many alternative options.

&gt;What I am trying to get at is that big business dominates. If the brand is considered a well known brand, chances are that they have subsidiaries and the idea of choice is an illusion. You could, for example, buy a beer not listed in the Wikipedia article, but chances are good that it's owned by yet another conglomerate. And if they also piss you off, you may be out of options. If ambitious, you could buy a truly local beer, one only sold in your neighborhood, but there is no such thing as a local branded TV. 

Choice is not an illusion. For everything you've named there are perfectly viable and available alternatives.

&gt;Oh, and if you think this is only about manufacturers, and not retailers, think again. Conglomerates rule that market too. [3] Federated stores owned many of the most popular stores where you may have shopped. The list goes on and on.

LWRellim,"&gt;Basically interest rates are near 0 and the banks are very risk adverse right now, so they sit on reserves instead of lending them out.

There is a very significant reason (actually a couple) that the banks are ""sitting on reserves"":

1. The large banks have HUGE derivative exposure and HUGE potential losses (and anyone who denies that has apparently been hiding under a rock and missed the news of JPMorganChase) -- while the reserves held are not enough to cover ALL of those potential derivative losses (nor do they have to), the bankers are uncertain of what their REAL exposure is, and so they want to (and indeed are probably being told to) hold onto enough to prevent a catastrophic ""insolvency"" situation.

2. The Fed is paying interest on excess reserves (likewise, this is no secret). This serves a two-fold purpose of making the banks *appear* to be solvent (even in the face of potentially HUGE derivative exposure); and secondarily it is a way to ""gift"" the banks with money -- known as ""recapitalizing"" them.

What Krugman is engaging in is simple misdirection. Now whether this is because he actually believes his own bullshit, or whether he is being intellectually dishonest... is anyone's guess. (Hanlon's razor would tell us it is the former, rather than the latter; but that isn't really dispositive in a single case and is rather a general principle. Occam's razor doesn't tell us anything in regard to this, since either is a fairly simple and straight-forward explanation; and given the history of ""economists"" as being professional apologists &amp; apparatchiks in service of the financial &amp; government establishment, the latter is at least as likely as the former.)",2012-06-20 00:35:56,c52nte6,1,economy

Glass-Steagall didn't say anything about sub prime mortgages, MBSs, CDOs, etc. The same thing would have happened with or without the separation of commercial and investment banks. Freddie and Fannie (Glass-Steagall said nothing about non-bank mortgage lenders) would still need their bailouts. AIG had nothing to do with the banking industry (it was an insurance company). Glass-Steagall also would have done nothing at all to prevent the crappy investment decisions of Lehman or Bear. If anything, I'd think the diversification of banking activities helped mitigate the problem (profits from the commercial arm could offset losses from the investment arm).

Also, without the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the type of Bank of America - Merrill Lynch and JPMorganChase - Bear Stearns mergers could not have happened. This would have resulted in a complete failure of nearly every one of the investment banks.

My point being that this author's main source of information for this article is the testimony of a single eye witness who may have not even understood the reason those plaques were even there.

Fair enough I missed that. But where are you getting ""the authors main source is a single eye witness""?

And where in the source material does it say that the plaques on the consoles are merely what they are monitoring?

Either way, the fact remains that the Wall Street banks and the NYPD are working together to massively monitor people without any oversight or input from the people, which is what the author is writing about, so you're criticism is really pointless.

&gt;This NYT articles which you linked to is about the NYPD surveillance network which is fine. I have no problem with that article or the way in which it was referenced to in this other particular article.

It's the same center &amp; same program in both articles.

&gt;The NYT article addresses the legality of the surveillance but in no way suggests that the banks or ""corporate partners"" are trying to ""spy"" on people. This is mostly about the NYPD teaming up with Wall Street area firms to conduct security surveillance.

There is no difference between spying and surveillance. Second, the author of the article you've been needling so much made it quite clear this is a ""surveillance"" program.  

&gt;This article however still doesn't support the idea that the ""1%"" is trying to illegally surveil citizens.

The legality of the program is not up to you, the NYT or the NYPD but to the courts. I never said the article proves the program is illegal, just that it exists.

Further, the only reference the author makes to it being illegal is:

&gt;The second significant story is that the largest police force in the country has tapped the public coffers to the tune of $150 million to operate what legal experts say is an illegal program.

The author says that after quoting Chris Dunn, Associate Legal Director of the NYCLU

&gt;“This decision opens the door to the argument that police camera systems that systematically track the movements and whereabouts of people in public places trigger constitutional scrutiny.  We have long believed that LMSI [Lower Manhattan Security Initiative]  violates the privacy rights of law-abiding New Yorkers, and this ruling from the Supreme Court supports that view.”

What exactly is the problem?

&gt;A program which all things set aside is not wholly without merit. Lower Manhattan is a huge terrorism target. The WTC resides in the Wall Street area so it's not as if the NYPD were trying to spy on the OWS protestors, something which the author alludes to in her opening line.

&gt;Yes, that's the issue at hand.

This is NOT the issue at hand which is my point. This article is about how the NYPD is working with the ""1%"" to spy on citizens.

on a quick preliminary summary:

- During the 1st 9 months of the year, JPM had $75B of revenues;

- $35B of which as interest income.

- During the same period its expenses were $60B ($22B of which was compensation, the biggest component).

- So, without those $35B of interest income, JPM would be under; 

- On the the Balance Sheet: out of its $2.1T of assets only $650B is loans (the rest being cash, deposited at the fed, and assets - but mostly cash because banks dont have substantial assets).

- So either those $650B have generated $35B of interest income in the 1st 9 months or there's a the federal reserve miracle on the remaining idle cash that is not loaned. 

- back of the envelope numbers; $35B on $650B, annualized, yields a miraculous 7% interest rate. that is, JPM can make an astonishing 7% on $650B of loans in an year.

- how likely is that given the low spreads in the market and long term interest rates being next to null ?

- Interest Income is the avg bank's bread and butter BUT: banks are [not lending](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCRESNS).

- Now, from whom does the op think that JPM is borrowing from and lending to ?

This is (alas) not at all true as far as being what the FDIC all does.

The FDIC serves as accuser, prosecutor, judge and jury regarding bank ownership (absent even any remote resemblance to ""due process"" -- it doesn't care about bankruptcy proceedings, chapter 7, 11 or 13 -- the FDIC steps in w/o any of that).

LWRellim,"&gt;But wouldn't it be possible to keep fractional reserve banking if we did it at a less-risky rate?
 
Here's the problem:

1. The value of a monetary unit is ""relative"" to it's supply versus it's demand; magically multiply the supply by a factor of 10x, and you simply reduce the relative value of a single unit to one 1/10 of it's previous value.

2. The ""benefit"" purportedly supplied by a fractional system is quite simply, to increase the supply of money.

3. Once the system has been ""fully fractionalized"" said increase (by definition) comes to an end, and you are (for all practical purposes) right back where you started (the only thing that has changed is that the FORMER owners of the currency now have LESS relative value in that currency, as it has via the *artifice of the Fractioning* been dispersed to holders of the ""newly created money"" (and via the mechanism of ""interest"" {on previously non-existent ""money""} a significant portion of the value has been ""siphoned off"" to the bankers/banksters in exchange for the ""magic"" act of fractioning).

4. No further benefit will be obtained -- UNLESS the ""fraction"" is reduced even further (and inevitably, it ALWAYS is -- as people/government demand ""more credit"").

5. The typical reason for the demand of more credit, is that the borrowers are having a difficult time repaying the loans (much less the interest) -- this is especially true if the system is played out OBJECTIVELY -- and as loans are paid off the amount of credit money decreases... the end result is MONETARY DEFLATION (i.e. a returning of the value of individual monetary units to their former 10x value).

6. Any such ""deflation"" makes it increasingly difficult (and at the eventual later stages, virtually impossible) for the borrowers to earn and replay the volumes of money (and interest) that they owe (keep in mind that the ""interest"" in terms of real money *does not exist* and never has existed as ""new"" money -- it MUST come from the stores of the ""old"" monetary units that pre-existed the fractionation.  If the interest rate were say 5% APR, but it is being charged on the basis of a 10% reserve, the it is being charged on a total ""money"" supply that is 10x the original existing money -- and 5% * 10x = 50% -- meaning that via 5% interest and 10% reserve, the ""bankers"" will have {ostensibly} gained claimant rights to upwards of 50% of the original money... that rather obviously is an untenable situation).

7. Ergo the bankers *collude* with the borrowers (again most frequently the ""government"") to roll over the debt and to further ""ease"" credit (i.e. increase the fractionation even further).

8. At various times/places along the way, there WILL nearly always be additional incentives for the bankers/banksters to ""call"" a loan (i.e. attempt to ""force"" a temporary deflationary situation in order to take advantage of the *disadvantaged/impossible/catch-22* situation the borrowers have gotten into; AND/OR as a means of forcing a ""run"" on their competition, a type of fratricide {an excellent *recent* example of which was the JPMorganChase takeover of WaMu} that will often allow them to gain all kinds of ill-gotten booty, but which just as frequently ends up being a form of internecine warfare that benefits no one and destroys just about everything around it).

9. And all the while -- the ""value"" of the monetary units fluctuates up/down -- it does NOT in and of itself generate ANY new actual production of goods (certainly nothing that could NOT have been created just as equally via other vastly less-damaging, less dangerous, non-fractional financial mechanisms {i.e. sale of stock shares, direct 1:1 lending, etc.}).

**Long story short, the only ones who REALLY benefit from fractional reserve banking... are the bankers.**  If the society ""gained"" any initial seeming benefit, said benefits are just as quickly LOST in either a) the loss of value of existing currency {typically owned by the frugal/prudent}; or b) in the inevitable ""crash"" the aftermath of the destruction of the bubble financing {aka the ensuing recession/depression}.

&gt;I've been taught that in order to increase wealth/grow your economy at a high rate, we need a fractional reserve system in place.

LWRellim,"&gt;Anyway. There are very much criteria for banks to be seized, particularly with capital ratios.

But they are only ""rules"" imposed at the *discretion* of the regulatory agencies. They are not like some immutable laws of gravity or physics.

The days of a bank failing because they *literally* had ""run out"" of currency... are long gone.

&gt;If a bank's tier 1 capital ratio falls below a critical threshold, they are given 30 days notice, and seized, more or less.

This only happens with relatively small banks (locals and regionals) -- and currently they are being given 60 and even 90+ days to attempt a private solution (I know of one area bank that is even well past THAT limit, yet they have not been seized, in part no doubt because the FDIC bank takeover crew already has its hands full) -- the largest ever was WaMu, and there is plenty of evidence that rather than being a true ""failure"" it was really more of a fraudulent ""seizure"" and a corrupt ""gift"" to JPMorganChase (which had been actively pursuing a merger/buyout of WaMu just months earlier).

&gt;That the largest banks never fell below this threshold (they most certainly did not) is largely a result of TARP capital injections, not some conspiratorial delusions.

&gt;Thus, regulatory forbearance was also granted to the large banks with respect to the establishment of reserves against past-due LDC loans. **According to Seidman, this forbearance was necessary because seven or eight of the ten largest banks in the U.S. might have been deemed insolvent,** a finding that would have precipitated an economic and political crisis. He noted that U.S. bank regulators, given the choice between creating panic in the banking system or going easy on requiring our banks to set aside reserves for Latin American debt, had chosen the latter course. It would appear that the regulators made the right choice. [46]

Personally I do not see it as much more criminal or much more scandalous then Tony Blair getting a job at Chase (http://investor.shareholder.com/JPMorganChase/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=286173 ). There were a lot hand wringing just because Gazprom is a Russian company  and therefore unusually evil. Generally in Western collective unconscious everything Russian is almost as bad as nuclear. 


IMHO Gazprom is moderately evil and corrupt (and certainly inefficient), but mainly  does not have nearly as good PR department as Exxon or even BP. The only reason it ever stopped delivery was for obnoxious  nonpayment. For example, Russia and Poland traditionally have fairly bad relations but Gazprom never stopped delivery to Poland (as Poland always pays its bills). 

However uranium is very easily transportable, can be bought from many different countries (it is difficult to imagine relationship between Germany and Australia or Canada getting so bad that they will refuse to sell uranium). It is easy to stock enough uranium to last for 10 years (and in emergency you can start uranium mining in Germany if required, although this would be stupid). Wind and solar on the other hand require increase in natural gas consumption, and natural gas can not be stocked as easily as uranium and can not be as easily delivered from across the ocean. Therefore energy security is not a good reason to reduce production of nuclear energy. 

But I am not German and hey -- they are free to do whatever they like. Of course we all will suffer from global warming caused by natural gas and other fossil burning, but this is certainly preferable to using sinful nucular energy.

Yes, I can see that.

&gt; The point I'm making is that it's not manipulation to point out that a bank is manipulating the price of silver.

Nonsense. If an individual says, ""I just heard a rumor that Corporation X is about to apply for Chapter 11"", that may be an effort to manipulate Corporation X's stock price.

If an influential person says, ""I have it on good authority that the big trading houses have artificially inflated the price of silver beyond any rational level"", that may well be part of an effort to cause the price of silver to drop.

This is an everyday occurrence. It's stupid, people should not pay attention to such things, but the fact is they do.

I think that certainly his recommendations about intrinsic motivation are correct and very important, but I am a little hesitant to accept at face value studies sponsored by the Federal Reserve and London, as I feel that these most established groups have more than earned their reputations for manipulation and deceit.

This finding also conveniently aligns with what ownership wants, i.e., a reason to NOT pay people more money, so that is a perk if you are selling this type of thing to executives. Another selling point for this is the ability to gain the wage earner's most entrepreneurial products with an implicit agreement not to share profits, while circumventing any propensity that employee might have had to compete with the corporation in those areas.

Anyway, those studies give me a great idea for improving the performance of executives at places such as JPMorganChase$$$ and GoldmanSucksAllTheMoney, etc.

I also think it would be appropriate for Pink to realize that the first part about the studies motivating reduction in financial incentives is a fraud.

He describes very short-term problem solving tasks. In these types of situations where one is being timed, increased incentive is going to increase stress. Stress decreases creative problem solving ability.

Very few people have jobs where their creative and problem solving abilities are applied in tests timed on the order of minutes and rewarded based on speed of completion.

This is not to say that intrinsic motivations such as autonomy and meaning are not excellent, although in the specific context he proposes, where one takes a pay cut and is expected to deliver his most brilliant ideas for new software systems to management, the employee may not benefit as much as he might hope.

LWRellim,"I'm not familiar with the banking laws/regs in Canada, but assuming they are similar to those in the US, then YES, it does have substantially to do with ""taxes"" as much as anything.

As for ""drug dealers"" (or any other ""off the books"" transactions -- meaning ""black/gray market"" activity -- aka ""untaxed"" and ""untraceable"" income) -- it definitely IS about ""money laundering"".

Basically they are just making a ""snapshot"" of that money as it is deposited -- then (especially should you engage in a ""pattern"" of such things) it is very likely that you will be audited, and required to provide some ""proof"" of how/why you were dealing with such quantities of ""cash"".

Keep in mind that the CHIEF and EASIEST way for governments to prosecute major black-market operations is under the tax codes (tax evasion).

And of course the whole point of ""money laundering"" is to be able to take big volumes of cash generated by black market activities and ""channel"" or ""funnel"" it through other VALID businesses (typically the types that also deal in sizeable amounts of cash/currency) in order to be able to ""move"" those sums within the banking system (as opposed to having to physically move those large aggregated sums of money).

However, all that said, it also serves a more ""sinister"" and less obvious purpose; that of getting people (and businessmen) to abandon/avoid the use of large amounts of ""cash/currency"" and instead to use checks and other ""digital"" (traceable) means of engaging in commerce. (The addition of the extra paperwork alone can make it a ""royal pain"" and annoyance to businesses, along with the inherent ""fear"" that it will trigger further annoyances of being subjected to audits, etc.) Most people -- like water &amp; electricity -- prefer and take the path of least resistance.

As to WHY it is so ""important"" these days to the system to encourage use of ""digital"" money (and discourage the use of actual currency) -- is that ""digital"" money never LEAVES the banking system, it is simply a bunch of accounting entries in the computer systems of different banks within the ""cartel"" system (regardless of country, ALL of the developed world has ""cartels"" of banks that are linked in this fashion its one of the ""self-definitions"" of ""developed world"").  And, by virtue of the fact that the ""money"" never physically ""leaves"" the banking system, the entire shell-game of fractional-reserve remains (virtually) unaffected, even by large transfers.

As long as other banks allow it to continue, any particular bank could have ALL of it's depositors ""withdraw"" their funds [via check and xfer to other banks] and yet still operate -- all that would change would that their accounting entries would have a bunch of minus ""-"" signs in front of the numbers. Of course if the knowledge of this ""run"" on the bank became widespread -- and why else would everyone ""move"" their ""money"" to other banks -- then, in order to preserve the ""perception/illusion"" [can't have people realize that the whole thing is a fraud, and that a bank does NOT really need any depositors] the bank will be officially ""closed"" and ""sold"" or ""merged"" with another bank that still has a ""perception"" of solidity, which then reassures the ""mob"" of the general public.

A literal example of this latter scenario is what happened with WaMu (Washington Mutual) last year. It really didn't MATTER that their accounting entries were all still in the ""positive"" (i.e. they did NOT have a bunch of minus ""-"" signs, and had NOT experienced a factual, substantial ""run"" on their depositors accounts) -- all that mattered to TPTB was that the ""perception"" was beginning to grow that WaMu was ""insolvent"" and the PERCEPTION that they had been or would be a ""run"" -- and if that happened and WaMu was allowed to continue to go about business as if nothing happened, then the public just *might* start to catch on... hence ONE of the ""needs"" for the ""bailouts"" and the ""confiscation"" and ""sale"" of WaMu to JPMorganChase.

Also JPMorganChase and Goldman Sachs were the two large banks who didn't actually fuck up and invest in mortgage securities. They didn't need bailouts.

JPMorganChase was given the money to buy smaller banks that failed that nobody would buy since the banks were worth less than zero dollars.

The FDIC uses several different methods to deal with failing banks.  The choice between different methods depends on the size of the bank and the circumstances.

1) Close down the bank and send depositors a check.  This might be done with extremely small banks.

2) Take over the bank and run it as a ""Federal Bank"" for a while, combined with loans and funds from the FDIC fund.  This is what was done with IndyMac, a medium sized bank.

3) Broker a deal to sell the failing bank, often with assistance.  WaMu was bought by JPMorganChase in this manner.  This was also done with Wachovia.  The FDIC actually brokered a deal with Citi to buy Wachovia, and Wells Fargo made a better offer.  There was litigation, and WF won.  This is done for large banks.

The FDIC has received a backstop loan from the Fed, which might cause ""printing"" if drawn upon like any other loan.  However, last I checked they had not drawn on this loan at all.

Back in May, four months before it collapsed, American International Group Inc. increased its dividend at the same time it unveiled plans to raise $12.5 billion in capital. Later, when its cash ran out, AIG got a government bailout, the size of which has expanded to about $150 billion.

Whether you call that a Ponzi scheme or something less sinister, AIG was paying old investors with money raised from new investors.

thephotoman,"Where do you want to go, career-wise?

I'm in the same boat (last semester!  w00t!), and yes, .Net/MSFT stack programmers are in high demand.  However, if you know Python, C, and Java, it's best to know that C# is a combination of the best features of those languages--it won't be hard for you to learn.  Perhaps some trivial work in the language this year won't hurt you.  

Don't be too afraid to exaggerate on your resume, at least when it comes to your skills.  Unless you're applying at a big company like Microsoft or Google (both of which have specific hiring programs for fresh grads), people are going to ask for the ridiculous and/or impossible (there are multiple occasions where I've seen demand for 10+ years C#/.Net experience, for example, or for more than 5 years of Ruby experience, which while not impossible is hard to come by).  In short, many HR directors don't actually know what their programming departments want.

Since you're looking for an East Coast job, I'd suggest looking at the normal banks.  A good number of them have massive software development wings that are deeply involved in making software to run the bank itself.  I've got several classmates that have gone off to work for JPMorganChase in particular.  Another friend works as a web programmer for an oil company.

If nothing else, talk to your department's industry coordinator (if you have one) or your university's placement office about job postings.",2008-09-29 03:11:59,c05maov,0,programming
