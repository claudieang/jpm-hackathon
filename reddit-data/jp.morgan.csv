who you insult because you're intellectually bankrupt and have to rely on banksters (ya know, the types who deliberately spread misinformation to impact stock values and pressure governments into what they want to happen) as your ""source of information"". Give me a fucking break. You trust people who crashed the economy then made taxpayers foot the bill.......and you act like they're a source to be trusted. jog the fuck on mate.

Which means absolutely nothing - do you understand how PR works? Clearly not. Sorry your brain can't handle the level of computation necessary to understand the basic realities of the modern era.  

""solely on what the EU wants""? you mean the organization that doesn't want us leaving? you also seem to think that these banksters are fawning over the Financial Transaction Tax - which btw will definitely be law of the land in the EU within 5 years. how would Ireland fare then?",2017-07-13 00:02:13,dk4h7og,3,europe

Louis_de_Lasalle,"Truth is most companies want intelligent people, the majority of training for the job is given in the company. To return to my previous example, if your graduate from St.Andrews you are guaranteed to be an intelligent young man or woman. While in the bottom universities, the people are for the most part mediocre, I kid you not that some people I have met from some low ranking universities have the written and spoken english aptitude of a 16 year old. Companies for most business jobs, don't need trained people, they need intelligent people. 

Naturally the fault is with the system, half of the universities in England or most countries should not exist, because they do not take university level minds and do not offer university level education. But there is such a vogue that all young people must attend university that this has created a two tier system where, in HR at least there are university graduates and 'university graduates'.

&gt;I can't believe someone with a degree in a certain Field from a low ranked uni is worse i a Job of said field than someone with a random degree of a top uni.

Well, most people don't end up doing what they study. Most people who go to oxford to study history don't end up becoming historians. The degree for most fields is just a show of intelligence. Buddy of mine who studied philosophy is now working as an investment banker in JP.Morgan. It is all about the quality of the university you graduate from.
