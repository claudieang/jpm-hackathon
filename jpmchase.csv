nelskc,"Have you considered applying to entry level credit analyst programs at a regional or community bank? Unlike the large Banks, community banks don’t typically hire interns that have been there and heading in to their senior year.

I didn’t get in to commercial banking til I was 29 and “started over” by joining a $20B asset bank (JPMChase is over $2T for comparison) to learn credit at one of my MW city’s regional banks that was headquartered in my city.

It was wonderful. Didn’t pay as well as the big guys, but I learned the foundational skills that have led me to a great career and developed skills there and now am at a large institution. TBH if pay was on par, I’d have stayed.

For what it’s worth I’m on my third career, so I’ve started over twice, and it’s amazing how fast things can improve if you feel like you’re just not where you want to be.

Also, comparison is the thief of joy so never bother comparing yourself to the milestones (especially in your 20s)!!!",2019-06-23 07:43:03,ertmt0i,1,personalfinance

- JPMChase, for their obscene involvement in the Great Fuckening of 2008 &amp; the sordid after-math, plus ongoing rent-seeking on industrial levels
- Google/Alphabet for turning into the precise opposite of its former ""don't be evil"" mantra &amp; serving as a machine for crushing uniformity/sanitizing, in both search &amp; content delivery
- Mastercard, for being a lynch-pin in enforcing the same through finance, including all recent payment platform issues (Patreon &amp; online so-called witch-aggregators like Gab.Ai, Voat, etc.)

Exitium_Deus,"Hi I'm Ellie.  I graduated in 2014 with a major in game design and Miners and computer science and software engineering. In 2015 I went through training for test automation and was eventually placed with an end client, JPMChase. 

Up to this point I have not taken care of my mental health issues. I had a suicide attempt during training and once I got my insurance after getting placed I sought help.  The medicine I took exasperated my sleeping issues and the result was I wasn't able to stay awake at work having a narcolepsy type symptom where I would uncontrollably fall asleep. In August 2016 my contract was ended and not renewed and I took this time to take a medical leave of absence from my company to focus on my health issues.

Mental health issues are fine I suffer from a little bit of anxiety now but things are a lot better. Sleep has definitely improved, but in the time between then and now part of it the last 11 months I've been working a night shift.  it's hard to say if I'll be able to hold a 9 to 5 without any sleep problems yet because of my schedule.

The questions I have are about how to get back into any programming career either as test automation or ethical hacking (considering going back for a master's in cyber security).  I currently live in Atlanta and well there are opportunities here I would prefer to live somewhere more liberal.  Portland being the highest on my list. 

With my situation and then I have recent work experience but not anything technical, is it possible for me to get placed and relocate to Portland? should I focus first on getting place in Atlanta and then in a year so try to move? Should I go back to a boot camp or back for my masters or will someone work with my experience from before even though I don't have anything recent?

ChekovsWorm,"Context of my recommendation is what I think is best for a new investor like the OP, who is not going to be using the excellent advanced trading tools that TD Ameritrade has. He/she is a brand new investor, with small amounts of money (not small to them!) doing a really smart move early in their work and adult life. Want to suggest places where they can make the most of it.

I'm talking about the overall mix of no-commission ETFs and NTF mutual funds, especially index funds that are GOOD index funds, in areas covering all asset classes (not just reddit's frequent idea of an ""index fund"" being the S&amp;P or a total US stock market.) Despite TD's recent expansion, Fidelity and Schwab both have a wider selection if you really look at the asset classes, factor / smartbeta / regional tilts available while still indexing. These are things that may well be the ""next step"" for a new investor. 

Also Fidelity and Schwab have a better, more comprehensive, well-explained, and cheaper bond / CD marketplace than other brokerages. Including much better than Vanguard's, which is one of  the many why I think Vanguard is only for members of reddit's most popular church, the ""Church of Vanguard"". (However it is a pretty good church! If you're only ever doing straight indexing.) 

If somebody is a stock trader, not just a buy-and-holder, then yes I think TD is great, especially if somebody understands and has a use case for using thinkorswim. Though I do like Schwab's StreetSmart just fine for advanced trading. Also, Fidelity has the best set of advanced trading tools right in its website, without having to use the separate desktop program, which unlike TD or Schwab, they don't allow for everyone, only for frequent traders. Fidelity lets you do brackets, ""trade armor"" exit strategies, and a wide variety of different spins on trailing stops, right from the web and most from the app as well, without needing the advanced trading program.

But for the OP and similar folks new to financial management, I'm also trying to point them to where they also can have much better primary banking than they are likely to be doing.  Including integrated really good bank checking (Schwab) or banking-alternative brokerage checking (Fidelity CMA) choices that can possibly be of use. Despite TD Ameritrade being (mostly) owned by the US subsidiary of Toronto Dominion Bank, their checking is less-integrated with brokerage than either SchwabBank with a SchwabOne account or Fidelity with a Fidelity Cash Management Account, and both of those checking accounts have better features than TD Bank USA's cheap checking. 

TD Bank is certainly better than big US money center banks like BofA, JPMChase, Citi, Wells (Canadian banks in general are less scummy, which is one of the reasons that the only ""money center"" bank names I directly own are Canadian, with my US bank stocks being only community and good regionals.) And TD Bank US does have local branches (Fidelity and Schwab do not have banking-services branches - no cash allowed in or out at their brokerage branches and cashiers checks need a prior request), so that may be a good choice of combined brokerage and bank if somebody is local to a TD Bank store.

TL;DR what a young new investor needs isn't the same as what a more advanced, primarily stock-trading experienced investor might want. Fidelity, Schwab, and to a much lesser extent, Vanguard, better fill the early-investor's needs while having lots of features for doing more later.",2018-06-04 00:17:34,e01nuun,2,investing
ChekovsWorm,"This is exactly what Chase, and BofA, and Citi, expect/hope/have brainwashed millions into doing. ""Free"" student accounts, then keep the suckers for life because they're lazy af. 

It's freakin' trivial to open a new checking account at a good, truly local or regional bank, or a credit union whose field of membership covers you, or one of the dozens of good credit unions that have easy ways for anyone to join.

And contrary to what the mostly ""self-propagandized"" BofA/JPMChase/Citi/Wells customers have convinced themselves is true, the credit unions and good regional banks DO have iOS/Android apps with mobile deposit, do have free BillPay, do have free ACH transfers to and from any other US banks and bank-like institutions, do have either wide free-ATM-use networks or other-bank ATM rebates (and if credit unions, have nearly every other credit union in the country as their ""local branch"" via Co-op Network Shared Branching), DO have all the things that ""only the big banks can offer.""

It takes what, maybe one day to move all your billpays to your new account. About 10 minutes on your job's HR/Payroll portal to change your direct deposit?

There's no reason to stay with the kind of account you're describing.

But even then I don't think that's disqualifying, he donated because Trump's stances are in line with his, not to buy the position, as he'd make far more continuing to work in industry.

10thflrinsanity,"Hello - I will do my best to sum up my career path/experience for you without getting lengthy, because I think you may find it beneficial. If you have further questions, I'm happy to answer them.

College: Started out in chemistry, took a couple of different turns through philosophy and theology (despite being non-religious, long story) and ended up in business. Was fascinated with economics, but ended up graduating with a finance degree (and chemistry minor) right after the 2008 financial collapse.  Perfect timing.

No jobs, especially the ones I wanted (analyst). So I ended up in a data entry job working for the Devil himself, JPMChase. It was during this time I learned much about the wrongdoings of Wall St. and quit a year later to the week. It was also during this time I became increasingly concerned with what I was reading about the environment and climate change. I ended up taking a job in underwriting and then switched to financial investigations (fraud) within a health insurance company before deciding to go back to do my MBA in Sustainability. I had had enough of arguing with doctors and lawyers, and I essentially came to the realization (much as James Balog did with the EIS) that I had to do something to combat the climate crisis... I had to find a  way to live with a clear conscience so I could eventually look at my (future) kids and say at least I tried.

It was during my first semester in my MBA program that a professor in my first sustainability course referred me to an analyst position in the sustainability dept of one of the top hospital systems in the country. I went through the long interview process, and long story short, I got the job, and that's where I am today.

I primarily deal with GRI and UNGC reporting, but I also gather metrics and run analysis and reporting on waste, energy, water,  supply chain, etc (waste and energy are the big ones since we have nearly 40 waste streams to track over a large number of properties).  We're even going dumpster diving next month. It's a pretty unique and dynamic position because I get to work with senior leadership throughout the organization. Don't fool yourself though, sustainability is on the rise in the NGO and corporate sectors because senior-level management sees the value in it from a cost/efficiency perspective (the profit part of the triple bottom line) and a green marketing perspective.  Sustainability is definitely a trend that is here to stay, but be aware, sustainability departments are still generally small, and therefore competitive to get into.  I think in the next 5 years this will change as more senior leadership from organizations across the globe catch up and budgets are freed up. To give you an idea how new sustainability is on the scene: in 2011 20% of S&amp;P 500 companies did some sort of sustainability report, in 2012 it more than doubled to 53%, and last year it was at 72%... most of whom were using the gold standard of sustainability framework: GRI. I think it's a great field to be in right now getting experience that will be valued in the coming years and highly recommend it. There are really many paths you can take and I may eventually end up in consulting (GRI) or public policy (I'd like to think I can someday make an impact that will make a positive difference for a substantial number of people, we'll see).",2014-12-30 22:01:16,cn9amj9,1,environment

&gt;Banks Moving In 

&gt;Banks intend to become the intermediaries in this fledgling market. Although U.S. carbon legislation may not pass for a year or more, Wall Street has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars hiring lobbyists and making deals with companies that can supply them with “carbon offsets” to sell to clients. 

&gt;JPMorgan, for instance, purchased ClimateCare in early 2008 for an undisclosed sum. This month, it paid $210 million for Eco-Securities Group Plc, the biggest developer of projects used to generate credits offsetting government-regulated carbon emissions. Financial institutions have also been investing in alternative energy, such as wind and solar power, and lending to clean-technology entrepreneurs. 

&gt;The banks are preparing to do with carbon what they’ve done before: design and market derivatives contracts that will help client companies hedge their price risk over the long term. They’re also ready to sell carbon-related financial products to outside investors. 

a couple more sources for the skeptics, banker/selected private investor owned derivative market is definitely the direction the Obama administration wants to go.

I've never heard of any other politicians proposing other solutions. It seems like banker owned Ponzi carbon derivative market is the way they wanted to go from the beginning, because it's the way Goldman Sachs wanted to go. http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/q42012/list-of-goldman-sachs-employees-in-the-white-house/ (scan the list all the way to the bottom, it's quite long). Goldman contributes to a lot of campaign donations, and hands out a lot of cash for good little politicians who give them what they want. the AIG bailout was all about making sure that Goldman collected all of the derivative bets that AIG was on the wrong side of without taking a loss. Similar can be said for JPMChase, they donated $4million to the NYPD the day Occupy Wall Street started, consequently a lot of peaceful protestors got the angry mob treatment from the police. 

Not saying the earth isn't getting warmer or that man isn't contributing, but if these scientists all believe the extremist IPCCs predictions of the soon coming future apocalypse and world flooding, then they are just as crazy as the people who said the world would end in 2012, or the 2011 Christian Rapture people, and Y2k and everyone else who predicted the world's demise before them. 

http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources-rx/images/1008/global-temperature-graph-69264-1.jpg chart shows the average change in temperate was less than 1 degree Celsius since 1850. notice that on the chart each line on the left side scale represents only 0.1 degree, the total average temperature range over the 150 year period was roughly 0.9 degrees Celsius. we've had many warming and cooling periods before man and before industrialization. High CO2 levels can also be explained by deforestation, urbanization and resource development and consumption has eliminated so many trees and plants (which are also carbon based- so they must be part of the problem as well and subject to carbon tax according to UN logic) which consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen in photosynthesis and now there is many less of them. 

http://www.thegwpf.org/leaked-ipcc-report-scientists-global-warming-rate-wrong/ 

IPCC reports based on selective science:

http://www.jimball.com.au/features/IPCC-False_evidence.htm - really worth a read. shows that IPCC altered studies and removed sections that didn't validate their theories on climate change.

http://www.mclean.ch/climate/IPCC.htm

IPCC gives no evaluation of the spectrum of the sun's ultraviolet radiation included in their model. Ultraviolet radiation concentration is increasing and shown to have correlation to earth's temp as UV radiation gets absorbed by Earth's atmosphere at a very high rate. here's that study- http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/3945/2013/acp-13-3945-2013.pdf 

The reason these people are so alarmist and make predictions of future climate driven apocalypse is because what if they told you that global warming wasn't a big problem? that would mean that IPCC and its scientists aren't necessary and that wouldn't be very persuasive to get you to sacrifice more of your rights and national sovereignty to the UN. Global Warming is their sales pitch to convince you that you need them. Don't worry folks just give us more of your money and control of your property to the government and its cronies and they will implement the magic solution.

Carbon is also a part of much other nonliving matter including diamonds, graphite, marble, limestone, etc. Nonliving organic matter (NLOM) comprises the bulk of the organic carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere and a major part of the organic carbon in the sea. The point is the ability to tax and completely regulate one of the most abundant elements on Earth is totalitarian control. Regulating general emissions without taxing carbon is reasonable.

the banker owned carbon derivate market can be confirmed at various sources. ALL taxes have strong tendency to get expanded. The banks have been top lobbyists for Cap-and-Trade.

&gt;Estimates of the potential size of the U.S. cap-and-trade market range from $300 billion to $2 trillion. 

&gt;Banks Moving In 

&gt;Banks intend to become the intermediaries in this fledgling market. Although U.S. carbon legislation may not pass for a year or more, Wall Street has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars hiring lobbyists and making deals with companies that can supply them with “carbon offsets” to sell to clients. 

&gt;JPMorgan, for instance, purchased ClimateCare in early 2008 for an undisclosed sum. This month, it paid $210 million for Eco-Securities Group Plc, the biggest developer of projects used to generate credits offsetting government-regulated carbon emissions. Financial institutions have also been investing in alternative energy, such as wind and solar power, and lending to clean-technology entrepreneurs. 

&gt;The banks are preparing to do with carbon what they’ve done before: design and market derivatives contracts that will help client companies hedge their price risk over the long term. They’re also ready to sell carbon-related financial products to outside investors. 

&gt;Masters says banks must be allowed to lead the way if a mandatory carbon-trading system is going to help save the planet at the lowest possible cost. And derivatives related to carbon must be part of the mix, she says. Derivatives are securities whose value is derived from the value of an underlying commodity -- in this case, CO2 and other greenhouse gases."" 

I've never heard of any other politicians proposing other solutions. It seems like banker owned Ponzi carbon derivative market is the way they wanted to go from the beginning, because it's the way Goldman Sachs wanted to go. http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/q42012/list-of-goldman-sachs-employees-in-the-white-house/ (scan the list all the way to the bottom, it's quite long). Goldman contributes to a lot of campaign donations, and hands out a lot of cash for good little politicians who give them what they want. the AIG bailout was all about making sure that Goldman collected all of the derivative bets that AIG was on the wrong side of without taking a loss. Similar can be said for JPMChase, they donated $4million to the NYPD the day Occupy Wall Street started, consequently a lot of peaceful protestors got the angry mob treatment from the police. 

Not saying the earth isn't getting slightly warmer or that man isn't contributing, but if these scientists all believe the extremist IPCCs predictions of the soon coming future apocalypse and world flooding, then they are just as crazy as the people who said the world would end in 2012, or the 2011 Christian Rapture people, and Y2k and everyone else who predicted the world's demise before them. 

http://www.nhm.ac.uk/resources-rx/images/1008/global-temperature-graph-69264-1.jpg chart shows the average change in temperate was less than 1 degree Celsius since 1850. notice that on the chart each line on the left side scale represents only 0.1 degree, the total average temperature range over the 150 year period was roughly 0.9 degrees Celsius. we've had many warming and cooling periods before man and before industrialization. High CO2 levels can also be explained by deforestation, urbanization and resource development and consumption has eliminated so many trees and plants (which are also carbon based- so they must be part of the problem as well and subject to carbon tax according to UN logic) which consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen in photosynthesis and now there is many less of them.

IPCC reports based on selective science:

http://www.jimball.com.au/features/IPCC-False_evidence.htm - really worth a read. shows that IPCC altered studies and removed sections that didn't validate their theories on climate change.

http://www.mclean.ch/climate/IPCC.htm

IPCC gives no evaluation of the spectrum of the sun's ultraviolet radiation included in their model. Ultraviolet radiation concentration is increasing and shown to have correlation to earth's temp as UV radiation gets absorbed by Earth's atmosphere at a very high rate. here's that study- http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/13/3945/2013/acp-13-3945-2013.pdf

ins1der,"Go through temp agencies. Dawson, Staffmark, Adecco, Randstad, etc. There are quite a few. I moved to Columbus 3 years ago and didn't know a soul here other than my girlfriend. Got on with a temp agency for $15 an hour doing a function that was going to be obsolete in 6 months for a well known company in the area. After that contract ended I had enough time on a job in the area that I got another temp position rather easily (Chase through their internal temp program ChaseWorks). Once I was there I did a good job, and was encouraged to apply for permanent positions within JPMChase after 3 months. I got a permanent position a month after that and haven't looked back since. I have since been promoted once in my current role, and was just hired in bigger and better role in the same area that I'll start at the beginning of August.

It's all about getting a foot in the door and in my opinion the easiest way to do that is temp agencies and positions.

shootx,"No,

The most annoying part about this is Fannie and Freddie are playing politics and winning.  No one is trying to hold them responsible despite being those ones who brought about ""the hustle.""  Loans don't get funded without meeting investor guidelines, how do I know, oh I work for Bank of America.  I wasn't part of Countrywide, but I do deal with work involved in cleaning up the mess those assholes caused.  Freddie and Fannie are turning around and suing because they were unhappy with the losses and the bank refused to pay them the 800 mil they demanded for their own mandated guidelines.  The bank actually does take on and payoff/bookloss loans that were created outside of their guidelines in error, but these aren't about those loans.  This is just them playing politics.  Shouldn't it seem a little too good to be true that both BAC and JPMChase getting huge litigation losses at the same time?  It's for the media to sway opinion.  Call it a tinfoil hat story, it's the hard truth.

No individual who relies on a popular vote or election is going to go against public opinion when it comes to the banks because in the public's eyes every bank is guilty because they are making money.  Money they would rather spend elsewhere.  Downvote here all you would like as I don't browse and post to reddit for internet points, but the truth in the matter is Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had just as much if not more involvement in the bubble collapse than Countrywide's most corrupt.  Few years back when I was a collections manager I got the ""privledge"" of sitting next to senior executives from fannie and freddie listen in on our agents as they do from time to time kind of like an informal audit.  These assholes laughed at some lady crying as she couldn't pay her mortgage while my associate attempted to find the best option for her to save her home.  They stated ""she was just trying to cry her way out of it.""

Now, I doubt most people will fully read this and turn on their selective interpretation modes, but I don't condone fraud, corruption, or whatever you want to call what happened in the past.  It's been made into a political scapegoat and turned the banking sector into a punching bag despite all parties involved being at fault.  (Banks, Borrowers, Investors, and the Government).  This is one of those hard truths I imagine people are going to instantly sour to, but it's the truth.  A perfect storm: Banks streamlining terrible mortgages to earn on servicing and originations... Borrowers taking out said bad mortgages even though they either can't afford them or are individuals with jobs who are not secure and have no stable plan to keep income flowing.  Investors demanding higher metrics in service agreements with banks (aka lenders) to turn more profit..  And last but certainly not least the government for not taking action until it was too late because they had their pockets lined by investors and lobbyists pushing a BUY BUY BUY Real Estate mentality.  Usually the blame game gets sides pinning blame on either the banks or borrowers but honestly that is like a Chicken and the Egg argument.  It's missing other facts and in this case it's missing investor and government faults.

Last, before this gets called a ""damage control,"" fuck the banks.  They could do better business for the communities.  Stick to a Credit Union. they are just as ""evil"" but they'll invite you to do fun things or give you free shit with less hassle and better rates.  ",2013-10-24 13:53:07,ccyhajd,3,politics

OrelHazard,"1) Wrong.  The North Side has far more *air travelers* who do *not pay taxes day in and day out* into the system from which CTA budgets are drawn.  It also has far more wealthy people whose effective federal income tax rates are rapidly approaching single digits on average, and only tiny shreds from these revenue flows have ever made it to USDOT granting and into the CTA.

2) If this factors in without regard to class, that means that the Blue and the Brown lines, when given equivalent track work will be shut down for comparable - or even longer - lengths of time than the South Red.  I am saying that will never, ever happen.  I hate to be the bearer of *good* news for the North side, but there are things that are politically thinkable and things that are not, and withholding El service for five months from the core constituency whose checkbooks fund the political campaigns in this city is not thinkable. 

3) No.  The state and city taxes that drive the CTA budget are drawn primarily from sales and payroll taxes which are paid by the poor at a far, far greater percentage of income than the wealthy, who are taxed on the largest portion of their income -- capital gains -- at effective rates approaching *zero*. You have it backwards and seem to have been steeped in the mythology that privilege is fairly concentrated in the hands of those who need it least.

4) *The poor do get a lot of services/benefits (city and beyond) that **wealthy people don't**. Housing assistance, Medicare, Food Stamps welfare etc.  I'm not some right-wing nut saying we should end or cut these programs.*  

Just like most liberals harboring such popular, delusional views, you may as well be a right-wing nut.

- Housing assistance that you don't understand the wealthy get in massive piles includes the mortgage income tax credits/incentives that allow skipping on hundreds of thousands of dollars on taxes per family, a set of families that far outnumber the families on direct housing assistance and so get *more* from that system than the poor.

- Medicare is not used to immense benefit by wealthy people?  Excuse me?  [Read this and get back to me](http://www.nber.org/digest/sep97/w6013.html), please.

- The wealthy don't benefit from food stamps?  Don't tell [$97 billion investment bank JPMChase](http://moneymorning.com/2013/04/09/why-jpmorgan-wants-to-see-more-americans-on-food-stamps/) - they might laugh at you. 

- Welfare.  Where to start, where to start.  The bank bailouts?  The defense industry?  The credit programs guaranteeing capital to industry?  The sad joke of [the federal tax code (list provided only to 2002: 11 years has made it 10x worse)](http://www.ctj.org/html/hemenu.htm)?

First, I'm a bit concerned because the mortgage was sold by  my local bank (as originator) to HomeSide which was then sold (as a company) to WaMu which was then sold (""stolen"") in its entirety by JPMChase -- and while that chain is fairly solidly established, will this ""MERS/MESS"" somehow cause me problems in the future? (Even though I have no immediate intentions to sell).

2. Second, while a release was recorded with the county when the mortgage was paid off, it was via JPMChase (an entity which was never on the title), and I now wonder not only about the validity of the release coming from them, but also about the validity of the signature &amp; notarization on that release (was THAT ""robo-signed"" by one of these ridiculous instant/faux ""Vice Presidents"" as well?  How would I {or anyone else} know?)

3. Third, and most remotely (but also the *scariest*) is that something in the above ""mess"" might somehow allow someone to place a claim against my home -- and via shenanigans foreclose on me (costing me boatloads to prevent or reverse).  While that seems somewhat ""paranoid"" to me -- I also recognize that when databases get FUBAR'ed, just about ANYTHING (however insane) suddenly becomes entirely possible -- I am also aware that my former local bank (the originator) is bordering on bankruptcy &amp; sale by the FDIC, and in the shenanigans that might ensue there, it is entirely possible that in the fiasco that ensues (said bank having been apparently involved in a bunch of ""shady"" RE deals) they might try to make some claim (however weak) against my property.

So, I've been researching and wonder whether it might not be prudent to file a [""quiet title""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_title) -- on the other hand, doing THAT (especially now) might just open up a can of worms, and the best might just be to let sleeping dogs lie, and see how all this crap plays out. (And a year or two from now -- once everything has settled down -- rethink about filing a ""quiet title"" to make everything 100% clear.)

**The really SAD thing about this whole frigging MERS mess** is that it has virtually destroyed the trust in the property record system.  I *had* been contemplating picking up a foreclosed property or two as an investment... now there is no frigging way I would do that (and I know I am not alone).

And then the thing that PISSES ME OFF even more is knowing that the banks did this MAINLY to save a few bucks on recording fees -- meaning my property taxes went up to compensate -- (though the real cynic in me wonders if they might not also have done it in order to ""sell"" the same mortgages as part of *multiple* MBS CDO's -- that would be worth a lot more to them as brokers than merely saving a $25 fee here or there -- and for anyone who thinks they would NEVER do such things, well [overbooking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling) is pretty standard in the airline industry, and is that *really* all that different from the inherent {albeit ""legalized""} fraud that is ""fractional reserve banking"" ? I can seem them justifying it as ""fractional reserve real estate"" just as easily as the industry justifies ""naked short selling"" as being non-harmful.)",2010-10-16 23:35:51,c12h0qr,3,Economics
LWRellim,"Yes. But then either the entire thing is then sold off, or it get's chopped up and sold in pieces.

The buildings don't go ""poof"". In the case of banks, the oustanding assets do not ALL go ""poof"", nor do ALL of the depositors disappear. (The FDIC could handle the breakup of a JPMChase in the same manner that they have handled the ""handover"" of a WaMu to JPMChase.)

xigam,"Jamie Dimon actually made a brilliant call and got JPMChase out of the sub-prime loan crap. 

Then turned around and helped bail out/buy out several other failing banks. Had those banks failed it would have cost the government even more.

They took the TARP money even when they didn't need it so that it wouldn't look like some banks were weaker than others, then paid it back plus interest.

Success should be rewarded, failure not so much (AIG).

MortgagePaidOff,"See this article for some good general [info/advice on prepayments](http://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Early%20Payoff/have_i_been_credited_for_my_prepayment.htm) -- BTW excellent website that I wish had existed (or I had known about) years ago (and as a disclaimer, no I am not ""connected"" with that website in ANY way, I just stumbled on it a few months back while helping a buddy buy his first house).

&gt;I have read how you did this, but will the ""extra"" you pay each month automatically go toward the principle? I have heard before that some mortgage companies will do nothing with a partial payment until many partial payments make a whole payment...do you know anything about that?

HA! Interesting that you asked this. *Oh, yes indeedy, I had some ""interesting experiences"" with this (did I ever!)*

First it is **critical** that [your mortgage does NOT have any prepayment penalties or fees](http://www.mtgprofessor.com/a%20-%20options/prepayment_penalty.htm) -- and you have to make certain that they didn't [""sneakily"" get you to agree to prepayment penalties or ""fees"" on the ""Truth [sic] In Lending"" document or any other piece of the mortgage contract paperwork.](http://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Mandatory%20Disclosure/disclosure_of_prepayment_penalty.htm).  

I *knew* was on safe ground with all of this because I was really watchful (and I mean *REALLY watchful*) for this kind of thing at closing (my original loan contract had a clear upfront section labeled ""BORROWERS RIGHT TO PREPAY"", and I had a lawyer verify it, as well as additional documentation that I described elsewhere).

In my experience, how much ""trouble"" you have actually getting extra payments properly credited against the principal will depend ENTIRELY on the mortgage processing company, their payment form, and whether you fill it out ""properly"" (i.e. that you clearly label the amount to be credited as an ""Additional Principal Payment"" in writing on the payment stub that goes with the payment check). 

Here's the details of my experience
-----

The first company I was with did not have a clearcut ""easy"" way of documenting an ""additional principal payment"" on their initial payment stubs -- and so even though I indicated by a hand written ""label"" that this was ""Add'l payment on principal"" they still made every kind of ""oops"" mistake possible: first they tried crediting the extra payments I made as ""escrow"" (the contract did not ALLOW them to collect escrow -- as long as I had 20%+ in equity (and my downpayment was 25%) I was entitled to save &amp; pay my own property taxes, take out my OWN insurance policy, and avoid PMI). So when they did this I started by making a phone calls to them (and continuing to make prepayments in the same manner) and followed up with a letter threatening a lawsuit (which got their attention so they stopped doing that); but then they tried logging them as a ""future payments"" (by this time I was making full on 2x payments -- meaning exactly twice the normal payment); and then, after I had my friendly local lawyer send them a cease &amp; desist letter (with documentation of all the dates &amp; what the principal amounts *should have been* plus copies of the payment forms w checks) they finally ""caved"" and back-credited everything to reduce the principal properly (within a few dollars/cents of the figures I had computed).

Then my mortgage service company was bought out by the (now infamous) Washington Mutual. WaMu had a much better payment form/stub, with a nice ""spot"" that was clearly labeled ""Additional Principal"" in the payment declaration area, and to their credit, they always attributed my extra payments properly; *but THEY tried something else! They took out their own home insurance policy(!!)* And with one of their subsidiary companies: ""Washington Mutual Insurance Co""  Can you say ""conflict of interest""? Can you say fraud? Especially since their ""insurance"" cost 3x what my locally purchased policy did. 

Now they claimed that they had sent me a notice &amp; bill for it (and maybe they did &amp; I accidentally threw it out w/o reading it -- in my defense, WaMu had this habit of sending me like 15 different pieces of junk mail EVERY month -- all in envelopes that looked EXACTLY like the standard payment statement -- trying to get me to sign up with them for a whole shitload of things, mostly ""insurance"" car/life/home -- eventually even a ""credit card"" &amp; agreement that, as far as I could tell, was basically a HELOC in disguise, but I digress). 

Anyway they claimed that they HAD to take out the policy and then when I didn't pay they added it to my principal balance (a definite no-no by the way). I had my own insurance (and just like the escrow and PMI, per the contract as long as I had 20%+ equity **I** was the one in charge of getting the home insurance -- side note here: I'm *told* that a lot of people are unaware that when they refi or do a HELOC and an equity ""take-out"" they drop below the 20% and can suddenly {""Surprise!""} find themselves paying escrow and PMI, and can even lose their ""right"" to manage/choose/pay the home insurance, etc.) -- I brought the lawyer back in with *another letter* (and my documentation of insurance, etc.) and eventually we got THAT all cleared up and properly removed from the principal as well (though they tried sending me a ""refund"" check -- which I rejected -- because what is important here is to make certain your payments are DATE-CREDITED properly, as the amount of ""interest"" charged to you each month is based on that, so basically by trying to ""refund"" me the extra principal, they were trying to keep extra interest that they were not entitled to, and yes this meant *yet another* lawyer-letter).

**Now were all of those things ""honest mistakes"" on their part like they claimed** Personally, I don't think so (but I also can't really PROVE it in court -- I *did* discuss suing them in court, but in my state I would have had to do so in small claims court and the ONE thing I had for a big expense -- my legal costs -- is something you CANNOT sue for in small claims here. It sucks, but whaddya gonna do?  BTW my local lawyer is great, so my total costs of mortgage related things -- from initial closing to the recent ""verify"" on the cleared mortgage lien -- were under $1K.) 

**So in the end, it was a bit of a PITA, but persisting through it was well-worth the effort; or at least I think so.** (I really think a lot of people would simply ""give up"" and go back to paying the normal payment -- which **I** think is the ""purpose"" behind the ""processing mistakes"" -- but again, I that is just my opinion and gut ""feeling"" on the matter, I have no proof. {But since WaMu technically no longer exists, it's not like they can come back from the dead and sue me!} ).

Hope that answers your questions. **Keep in mind that YMMV -- and my experiences (problems) may or may NOT be typical** -- I have friends who have made a few extra prepayments (tax refunds, etc.) and they encountered NONE of the ""oops"" problems that I did -- but keep in mind that during the short 7+ years I had my mortgage it was owned/serviced by no less than 4 different banks/companies (and each time the company changed, new ""complications"" ensued -- by the time JPMChase took over WaMu, I had reverted back to making regular ""standard"" payments and the ""extra"" payments I made were unquestionably large ""lump sum"" payments that were all properly credited, I didn't have any problems with them until the end and the final payoff -- but that's another story for another time!)",2009-10-31 15:01:39,c0f5up4,3,IAmA
UncleOxidant,"I wish everyone with an account in JPMChase, Citibank, BofA and Wells Fargo would move their money to a local credit union... that way we don't have to wait for them to ""tear each other up"".",2009-10-21 10:17:26,c0epzen,2,Economics
LWRellim,"It also includes a total misunderstanding of how the structure of banking has changed since the 1930's depression.

Back then, banks were pretty local -- most of the ones that failed had a single location -- you did not see banks with multiple 10's and 100's of ""branch"" offices.

**I would bet that if you added up all of the branch offices of the banks that have failed this year+, the number of failed ""facilities"" would be at or above the number of banks that failed during the depression era.** (And that is NOT counting the branches of the big banks like of JPMChase, Citi and BofA -- which WOULD have been insolvent/bankrupt had not the Fed ""donated"" such large chunks of money to underwrite them).

On top of that, we're talking the number that have failed WITHIN only a little more than a YEAR of the market crash -- majority of the banks that failed in the depression did not fail in 1929-1930, but rather in the subsequent years 1931-1933 (and we're not that far in yet) -- so the comparison is premature.",2009-10-21 04:13:49,c0ephfl,4,Economics
LWRellim,"To make it short &amp; sweet -- ""regulation"" is a way for corporations to USE government to restrict competition and ""embed"" themselves into a system -- especially if they can ""capture"" the regulators (the promise of not only campaign financing, but a ""soft landing"" into a cushy private or think-tank job -- via the revolving door -- in case of electoral loss or power-shift), and thus influence them to engage in only ""selective"" prosecution of minor players (which then become ""easy pickings"" for emergency mergers and the further growth of the big players).

In short, you are an ""idealist"" -- whereas the corporations are trying (and succeeding) at ""gaming"" the system -- who do you think will win?

To wit: Just look at the ""too big to fail"" scenario of the biggest banks -- they not only managed to NOT be broken up via insolvency (they were ALL insolvent) -- but have managed to use the ""emergency"" as an opportunity to have the ""regulators"" not only allow, but to actually facilitate the hand over of their competition ...on a silver platter no less (often virtually for free or even subsidized -- see the whole JPMChase ""rescue"" of WaMu for a prime example).

You need to pull your head out of the sand, dude. In an ideal world, the regulators would be ""johnny on the spot"" and work like you imagine; but in the down-and-dirty world that is reality, it works the OPPOSITE of what you think, and ""regulation"" ends up simply being ""gamed"" and used &amp; abused to protect and extend the power of the established corporations.",2009-10-10 14:43:07,c0e8z8a,3,Economics
